0.2.4
- try/except when the mapper sets init.__name__ on a mapped class,
supports python 2.3
- fixed bug where threadlocal engine would still autocommit
despite a transaction in progress
- lazy load and deferred load operations require the parent object
to be in a Session to do the operation; whereas before the operation
would just return a blank list or None, it now raises an exception.
- Session.update() is slightly more lenient if the session to which
the given object was formerly attached to was garbage collected;
otherwise still requires you explicitly remove the instance from 
the previous Session.
- fixes to mapper compilation, checking for more error conditions
- small fix to eager loading combined with ordering/limit/offset
- utterly remarkable:  added a single space between 'CREATE TABLE'
and '(<the rest of it>' since *thats how MySQL indicates a non-
reserved word tablename.....* [ticket:206]
- more fixes to inheritance, related to many-to-many relations
properly saving
- fixed bug when specifying explicit module to mysql dialect
- when QueuePool times out it raises a TimeoutError instead of
erroneously making another connection
- Queue.Queue usage in pool has been replaced with a locally
modified version (works in py2.3/2.4!) that uses a threading.RLock 
for a mutex.  this is to fix a reported case where a ConnectionFairy's 
__del__() method got called within the Queue's get() method, which 
then returns its connection to the Queue via the the put() method, 
causing a reentrant hang unless threading.RLock is used.
- postgres will not place SERIAL keyword on a primary key column
if it has a foreign key constraint
- cursor() method on ConnectionFairy allows db-specific extension
arguments to be propigated [ticket:221]
- lazy load bind params properly propigate column type [ticket:225]
- new MySQL types: MSEnum, MSTinyText, MSMediumText, MSLongText, etc.
more support for MS-specific length/precision params in numeric types
patch courtesy Mike Bernson
- some fixes to connection pool invalidate() [ticket:224]

0.2.3
- overhaul to mapper compilation to be deferred.  this allows mappers
to be constructed in any order, and their relationships to each
other are compiled when the mappers are first used.
- fixed a pretty big speed bottleneck in cascading behavior particularly
when backrefs were in use
- the attribute instrumentation module has been completely rewritten; its
now a large degree simpler and clearer, slightly faster.  the "history"
of an attribute is no longer micromanaged with each change and is
instead part of a "CommittedState" object created when the 
instance is first loaded.  HistoryArraySet is gone, the behavior of
list attributes is now more open ended (i.e. theyre not sets anymore).
- py2.4 "set" construct used internally, falls back to sets.Set when
"set" not available/ordering is needed.
- fix to transaction control, so that repeated rollback() calls 
dont fail (was failing pretty badly when flush() would raise 
an exception in a larger try/except transaction block)
- "foreignkey" argument to relation() can also be a list.  fixed
auto-foreignkey detection [ticket:151]
- fixed bug where tables with schema names werent getting indexed in
the MetaData object properly
- fixed bug where Column with redefined "key" property wasnt getting
type conversion happening in the ResultProxy [ticket:207]
- fixed 'port' attribute of URL to be an integer if present
- fixed old bug where if a many-to-many table mapped as "secondary"
had extra columns, delete operations didnt work
- bugfixes for mapping against UNION queries
- fixed incorrect exception class thrown when no DB driver present
- added NonExistentTable exception thrown when reflecting a table
that doesnt exist [ticket:138]
- small fix to ActiveMapper regarding one-to-one backrefs, other
refactorings
- overridden constructor in mapped classes gets __name__ and
__doc__ from the original class
- fixed small bug in selectresult.py regarding mapper extension
[ticket:200]
- small tweak to cascade_mappers, not very strongly supported 
function at the moment
- some fixes to between(), column.between() to propigate typing
information better [ticket:202]
- if an object fails to be constructed, is not added to the 
session [ticket:203]
- CAST function has been made into its own clause object with
its own compilation function in ansicompiler; allows MySQL
to silently ignore most CAST calls since MySQL
seems to only support the standard CAST syntax with Date types.  
MySQL-compatible CAST support for strings, ints, etc. a TODO

0.2.2
- big improvements to polymorphic inheritance behavior, enabling it
to work with adjacency list table structures [ticket:190]
- major fixes and refactorings to inheritance relationships overall,
more unit tests
- fixed "echo_pool" flag on create_engine()
- fix to docs, removed incorrect info that close() is unsafe to use
with threadlocal strategy (its totally safe !)
- create_engine() can take URLs as string or unicode [ticket:188]
- firebird support partially completed; 
thanks to James Ralston and Brad Clements for their efforts.
- Oracle url translation was broken, fixed, will feed host/port/sid
into cx_oracle makedsn() if 'database' field is present, else uses 
straight TNS name from the 'host' field
- fix to using unicode criterion for query.get()/query.load()
- count() function on selectables now uses table primary key or 
first column instead of "1" for criterion, also uses label "rowcount"
instead of "count".  
- got rudimental "mapping to multiple tables" functionality cleaned up, 
more correctly documented
- restored global_connect() function, attaches to a DynamicMetaData
instance called "default_metadata".  leaving MetaData arg to Table
out will use the default metadata.
- fixes to session cascade behavior, entity_name propigation
- reorganized unittests into subdirectories
- more fixes to threadlocal connection nesting patterns

0.2.1
- "pool" argument to create_engine() properly propigates
- fixes to URL, raises exception if not parsed, does not pass blank
fields along to the DB connect string (a string such as 
user:host@/db was breaking on postgres)
- small fixes to Mapper when it inserts and tries to get
new primary key values back
- rewrote half of TLEngine, the ComposedSQLEngine used with 
'strategy="threadlocal"'.  it now properly implements engine.begin()/
engine.commit(), which nest fully with connection.begin()/trans.commit().
added about six unittests.
- major "duh" in pool.Pool, forgot to put back the WeakValueDictionary.
unittest which was supposed to check for this was also silently missing
it.  fixed unittest to insure that ConnectionFairy properly falls out
of scope.
- placeholder dispose() method added to SingletonThreadPool, doesnt 
do anything yet
- rollback() is automatically called when an exception is raised,
but only if theres no transaction in process (i.e. works more like
autocommit).
- fixed exception raise in sqlite if no sqlite module present
- added extra example detail for association object doc
- Connection adds checks for already being closed

0.2.0
- overhaul to Engine system so that what was formerly the SQLEngine
is now a ComposedSQLEngine which consists of a variety of components,
including a Dialect, ConnectionProvider, etc. This impacted all the
db modules as well as Session and Mapper.
- create_engine now takes only RFC-1738-style strings:
driver://user:password@host:port/database
- total rewrite of connection-scoping methodology, Connection objects
can now execute clause elements directly, added explicit "close" as
well as support throughout Engine/ORM to handle closing properly,
no longer relying upon __del__ internally to return connections 
to the pool [ticket:152].
- overhaul to Session interface and scoping.  uses hibernate-style
methods, including query(class), save(), save_or_update(), etc.
no threadlocal scope is installed by default.  Provides a binding
interface to specific Engines and/or Connections so that underlying
Schema objects do not need to be bound to an Engine.  Added a basic
SessionTransaction object that can simplistically aggregate transactions 
across multiple engines.
- overhaul to mapper's dependency and "cascade" behavior; dependency logic
factored out of properties.py into a separate module "dependency.py".
"cascade" behavior is now explicitly controllable, proper implementation 
of "delete", "delete-orphan", etc.  dependency system can now determine at 
flush time if a child object has a parent or not so that it makes better 
decisions on how that child should be updated in the DB with regards to deletes.
- overhaul to Schema to build upon MetaData object instead of an Engine.
Entire SQL/Schema system can be used with no Engines whatsoever, executed
solely by an explicit Connection object.  the "bound" methodlogy exists via the 
BoundMetaData for schema objects.  ProxyEngine is generally not needed
anymore and is replaced by DynamicMetaData.
- true polymorphic behavior implemented, fixes [ticket:167]
- "oid" system has been totally moved into compile-time behavior; 
if they are used in an order_by where they are not available, the order_by
doesnt get compiled, fixes [ticket:147]
- overhaul to packaging; "mapping" is now "orm", "objectstore" is now
"session", the old "objectstore" namespace gets loaded in via the
"threadlocal" mod if used
- mods now called in via "import <modname>".  extensions favored over
mods as mods are globally-monkeypatching
- fix to add_property so that it propigates properties to inheriting 
mappers [ticket:154]
- backrefs create themselves against primary mapper of its originating
property, priamry/secondary join arguments can be specified to override.
helps their usage with polymorphic mappers
- "table exists" function has been implemented [ticket:31]
- "create_all/drop_all" added to MetaData object [ticket:98]
- improvements and fixes to topological sort algorithm, as well as more
unit tests
- tutorial page added to docs which also can be run with a custom doctest
runner to insure its properly working.  docs generally overhauled to 
deal with new code patterns
- many more fixes, refactorings.
- migration guide is available on the Wiki at 
http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/wiki/02Migration

0.1.7
- some fixes to topological sort algorithm
- added DISTINCT ON support to Postgres (just supply distinct=[col1,col2..])
- added __mod__ (% operator) to sql expressions
- "order_by" mapper property inherited from inheriting mapper
- fix to column type used when mapper UPDATES/DELETEs
- with convert_unicode=True, reflection was failing, has been fixed
- types types types!  still werent working....have to use TypeDecorator again :(
- mysql binary type converts array output to buffer, fixes PickleType
- fixed the attributes.py memory leak once and for all
- unittests are qualified based on the databases that support each one
- fixed bug where column defaults would clobber VALUES clause of insert objects
- fixed bug where table def w/ schema name would force engine connection
- fix for parenthesis to work correctly with subqueries in INSERT/UPDATE
- HistoryArraySet gets extend() method
- fixed lazyload support for other comparison operators besides =
- lazyload fix where two comparisons in the join condition point to the 
samem column
- added "construct_new" flag to mapper, will use __new__ to create instances
instead of __init__ (standard in 0.2)
- added selectresults.py to SVN, missed it last time
- tweak to allow a many-to-many relationship from a table to itself via
an association table
- small fix to "translate_row" function used by polymorphic example
- create_engine uses cgi.parse_qsl to read query string (out the window in 0.2)
- tweaks to CAST operator
- fixed function names LOCAL_TIME/LOCAL_TIMESTAMP -> LOCALTIME/LOCALTIMESTAMP
- fixed order of ORDER BY/HAVING in compile

0.1.6
- support for MS-SQL added courtesy Rick Morrison, Runar Petursson
- the latest SQLSoup from J. Ellis
- ActiveMapper has preliminary support for inheritance (Jeff Watkins)
- added a "mods" system which allows pluggable modules that modify/augment
core functionality, using the function "install_mods(*modnames)".
- added the first "mod", SelectResults, which modifies mapper selects to
return generators that turn ranges into LIMIT/OFFSET queries (Jonas Borgström)
- factored out querying capabilities of Mapper into a separate Query object
which is Session-centric.  this improves the performance of mapper.using(session)
and makes other things possible.
- objectstore/Session refactored, the official way to save objects is now 
via the flush() method.  The begin/commit functionality of Session is factored
into LegacySession which is still established as the default behavior, until
the 0.2 series.
- types system is bound to an engine at query compile time, not schema
construction time.  this simplifies the types system as well as the ProxyEngine.
- added 'version_id' keyword argument to mapper. this keyword should reference a
Column object with type Integer, preferably non-nullable, which will be used on
the mapped table to track version numbers. this number is incremented on each
save operation and is specifed in the UPDATE/DELETE conditions so that it
factors into the returned row count, which results in a ConcurrencyError if the
value received is not the expected count.
- added 'entity_name' keyword argument to mapper. a mapper is now associated
with a class via the class object as well as an optional entity_name parameter,
which is a string defaulting to None. any number of primary mappers can be
created for a class, qualified by the entity name. instances of those classes
will issue all of their load and save operations through their
entity_name-qualified mapper, and maintain separate a identity in the identity
map for an otherwise equilvalent object.
- overhaul to the attributes system. code has been clarified, and also fixed to
support proper polymorphic behavior on object attributes.
- added "for_update" flag to Select objects
- some fixes for backrefs
- fix for postgres1 DateTime type
- documentation pages mostly switched over to Markdown syntax

0.1.5
- added SQLSession concept to SQLEngine. this object keeps track of retrieving a
connection from the connection pool as well as an in-progress transaction.
methods push_session() and pop_session() added to SQLEngine which push/pop a new
SQLSession onto the engine, allowing operation upon a second connection "nested"
within the previous one, allowing nested transactions. Other tricks are sure to
come later regarding SQLSession.
- added nest_on argument to objectstore.Session. This is a single SQLEngine or
list of engines for which push_session()/pop_session() will be called each time
this Session becomes the active session (via objectstore.push_session() or
equivalent). This allows a unit of work Session to take advantage of the nested
transaction feature without explicitly calling push_session/pop_session on the
engine.
- factored apart objectstore/unitofwork to separate "Session scoping" from
"uow commit heavy lifting"
- added populate_instance() method to MapperExtension. allows an extension to
modify the population of object attributes. this method can call the
populate_instance() method on another mapper to proxy the attribute population
from one mapper to another; some row translation logic is also built in to help
with this.
- fixed Oracle8-compatibility "use_ansi" flag which converts JOINs to 
comparisons with the = and (+) operators, passes basic unittests
- tweaks to Oracle LIMIT/OFFSET support
- Oracle reflection uses ALL_** views instead of USER_** to get larger
list of stuff to reflect from
- fixes to Oracle foreign key reflection [ticket:105]
- objectstore.commit(obj1, obj2,...) adds an extra step to seek out private
relations on properties and delete child objects, even though its not a global
commit
- lots and lots of fixes to mappers which use inheritance, strengthened the 
concept of relations on a mapper being made towards the "local" table for that
mapper, not the tables it inherits.  allows more complex compositional patterns
to work with lazy/eager loading.
- added support for mappers to inherit from others based on the same table, 
just specify the same table as that of both parent/child mapper.
- some minor speed improvements to the attributes system with regards to 
instantiating and populating new objects. 
- fixed MySQL binary unit test
- INSERTs can receive clause elements as VALUES arguments, not just literal
values
- support for calling multi-tokened functions, i.e. schema.mypkg.func()
- added J. Ellis' SQLSoup module to extensions package
- added "polymorphic" examples illustrating methods to load multiple object types
from one mapper, the second of which uses the new populate_instance() method.
small improvements to mapper, UNION construct to help the examples along
- improvements/fixes to session.refresh()/session.expire() (which may have
been called "invalidate" earlier..)
- added session.expunge() which totally removes an object from the current
session
- added *args, **kwargs pass-thru to engine.transaction(func) allowing easier
creation of transactionalizing decorator functions
- added iterator interface to ResultProxy:  "for row in result:..."
- added assertion to tx = session.begin(); tx.rollback(); tx.begin(), i.e. cant
use it after a rollback()
- added date conversion on bind parameter fix to SQLite enabling dates to
work with pysqlite1
- improvements to subqueries to more intelligently construct their FROM
clauses [ticket:116]
- added PickleType to types.
- fixed two bugs with column labels with regards to bind parameters: bind param
keynames they are now generated from a column "label" in all relevant cases to
take advantage of excess-name-length rules, and checks for a peculiar collision
against a column named the same as "tablename_colname" added
- major overhaul to unit of work documentation, other documentation sections.
- fixed attributes bug where if an object is committed, its lazy-loaded list got 
blown away if it hadnt been loaded
- added unique_connection() method to engine, connection pool to return a
connection that is not part of the thread-local context or any current
transaction
- added invalidate() function to pooled connection.  will remove the connection
from the pool.  still need work for engines to auto-reconnect to a stale DB
though.
- added distinct() function to column elements so you can do
func.count(mycol.distinct())
- added "always_refresh" flag to Mapper, creates a mapper that will always
refresh the attributes of objects it gets/selects from the DB, overwriting any
changes made.

0.1.4
- create_engine() now uses genericized parameters; host/hostname,
db/dbname/database, password/passwd, etc. for all engine connections. makes
 engine URIs much more "universal"
- added support for SELECT statements embedded into a column clause, using the
flag "scalar=True"
- another overhaul to EagerLoading when used in conjunction with mappers that
inherit; improvements to eager loads figuring out their aliased queries
correctly, also relations set up against a mapper with inherited mappers will
create joins against the table that is specific to the mapper itself (i.e. and
not any tables that are inherited/are further down the inheritance chain),
this can be overridden by using custom primary/secondary joins.
- added J.Ellis patch to mapper.py so that selectone() throws an exception 
if query returns more than one object row, selectfirst() to not throw the 
exception. also adds selectfirst_by (synonymous with get_by) and selectone_by
- added onupdate parameter to Column, will exec SQL/python upon an update
statement.Also adds "for_update=True" to all DefaultGenerator subclasses
- added support for Oracle table reflection contributed by Andrija Zaric; 
still some bugs to work out regarding composite primary keys/dictionary selection
- checked in an initial Firebird module, awaiting testing.
- added sql.ClauseParameters dictionary object as the result for 
compiled.get_params(), does late-typeprocessing of bind parameters so 
that the original values are easier to access
- more docs for indexes, column defaults, connection pooling, engine construction
- overhaul to the construction of the types system. uses a simpler inheritance
pattern so that any of the generic types can be easily subclassed, with no need
for TypeDecorator.
- added "convert_unicode=False" parameter to SQLEngine, will cause all String
types to perform unicode encoding/decoding (makes Strings act like Unicodes)
- added 'encoding="utf8"' parameter to engine.  the given encoding will be 
used for all encode/decode calls within Unicode types as well as Strings 
when convert_unicode=True.
- improved support for mapping against UNIONs, added polymorph.py example
to illustrate multi-class mapping against a UNION
- fix to SQLite LIMIT/OFFSET syntax
- fix to Oracle LIMIT syntax
- added backref() function, allows backreferences to have keyword arguments
that will be passed to the backref.
- Sequences and ColumnDefault objects can do execute()/scalar() standalone
- SQL functions (i.e. func.foo()) can do execute()/scalar() standalone
- fix to SQL functions so that the ANSI-standard functions, i.e. current_timestamp
etc., do not specify parenthesis.  all other functions do.
- added settattr_clean and append_clean to SmartProperty, which set 
attributes without triggering a "dirty" event or any history. used as:
myclass.prop1.setattr_clean(myobject, 'hi')
- improved support to column defaults when used by mappers; mappers will pull
pre-executed defaults from statement's executed bind parameters
(pre-conversion) to populate them into a saved object's attributes; if any
PassiveDefaults have fired off, will instead post-fetch the row from the DB to
populate the object.
- added 'get_session().invalidate(*obj)' method to objectstore, instances will
refresh() themselves upon the next attribute access.
- improvements to SQL func calls including an "engine" keyword argument so
they can be execute()d or scalar()ed standalone, also added func accessor to
SQLEngine
- fix to MySQL4 custom table engines, i.e. TYPE instead of ENGINE
- slightly enhanced logging, includes timestamps and a somewhat configurable
formatting system, in lieu of a full-blown logging system
- improvements to the ActiveMapper class from the TG gang, including
many-to-many relationships
- added Double and TinyInt support to mysql

0.1.3
- completed "post_update" feature, will add a second update statement before
inserts and after deletes in order to reconcile a relationship without any
dependencies being created; used when persisting two rows that are dependent
on each other
- completed mapper.using(session) function, localized per-object Session
functionality; objects can be declared and manipulated as local to any
user-defined Session
- fix to Oracle "row_number over" clause with multiple tables
- mapper.get() was not selecting multiple-keyed objects if the mapper's table was a join,
such as in an inheritance relationship, this is fixed.
- overhaul to sql/schema packages so that the sql package can run all on its own,
producing selects, inserts, etc. without any engine dependencies.  builds upon
new TableClause/ColumnClause lexical objects.  Schema's Table/Column objects
are the "physical" subclasses of them.  simplifies schema/sql relationship,
extensions (like proxyengine), and speeds overall performance by a large margin. 
removes the entire getattr() behavior that plagued 0.1.1.
- refactoring of how the mapper "synchronizes" data between two objects into a
separate module, works better with properties attached to a mapper that has an 
additional inheritance relationship to one of the related tables, also the same
methodology used to synchronize parent/child objects now used by mapper to
synchronize between inherited and inheriting mappers.
- made objectstore "check for out-of-identitymap" more aggressive, will perform the
check when object attributes are modified or the object is deleted
- Index object fully implemented, can be constructed standalone, or via
"index" and "unique" arguments on Columns.
- added "convert_unicode" flag to SQLEngine, will treat all String/CHAR types
as Unicode types, with raw-byte/utf-8 translation on the bind parameter and 
result set side.
- postgres maintains a list of ANSI functions that must have no parenthesis so
function calls with no arguments work consistently
- tables can be created with no engine specified.  this will default their engine
to a module-scoped "default engine" which is a ProxyEngine.  this engine can 
be connected via the function "global_connect".
- added "refresh(*obj)" method to objectstore / Session to reload the attributes of
any set of objects from the database unconditionally

0.1.2
- fixed a recursive call in schema that was somehow running 994 times then returning
normally.  broke nothing, slowed down everything.  thanks to jpellerin for finding this.

0.1.1
- small fix to Function class so that expressions with a func.foo() use the type of the
Function object (i.e. the left side) as the type of the boolean expression, not the 
other side which is more of a moving target (changeset 1020).
- creating self-referring mappers with backrefs slightly easier (but still not that easy -
changeset 1019)
- fixes to one-to-one mappings (changeset 1015)
- psycopg1 date/time issue with None fixed (changeset 1005)
- two issues related to postgres, which doesnt want to give you the "lastrowid"
since oids are deprecated:
   * postgres database-side defaults that are on primary key cols *do* execute 
explicitly beforehand, even though thats not the idea of a PassiveDefault.  this is
because sequences on columns get reflected as PassiveDefaults, but need to be explicitly
executed on a primary key col so we know what we just inserted.  
   * if you did add a row that has a bunch of database-side defaults on it, 
and the PassiveDefault thing was working the old way, i.e. they just execute on 
the DB side, the "cant get the row back without an OID" exception that occurred
also will not happen unless someone (usually the ORM) explicitly asks for it.
- fixed a glitch with engine.execute_compiled where it was making a second 
ResultProxy that just got thrown away.
- began to implement newer logic in object properities.  you can now say
myclass.attr.property, which will give you the PropertyLoader corresponding to that
attribute, i.e. myclass.mapper.props['attr']
- eager loading has been internally overhauled to use aliases at all times.  more 
complicated chains of eager loads can now be created without any need for explicit
"use aliases"-type instructions.  EagerLoader code is also much simpler now.
- a new somewhat experimental flag "use_update" added to relations, indicates that 
this relationship should be handled by a second UPDATE statement, either after a 
primary INSERT or before a primary DELETE.  handles circular row dependencies.
- added exceptions module, all raised exceptions (except for some 
KeyError/AttributeError exceptions) descend from these classes.
- fix to date types with MySQL, returned timedelta converted to datetime.time
- two-phase objectstore.commit operations (i.e. begin/commit) now return a 
transactional object (SessionTrans), to more clearly indicate transaction boundaries.
- Index object with create/drop support added to schema
- fix to postgres, where it will explicitly pre-execute a PassiveDefault on a table
if it is a primary key column, pursuant to the ongoing "we cant get inserted rows 
back from postgres" issue
- change to information_schema query that gets back postgres table defs, now
uses explicit JOIN keyword, since one user had faster performance with 8.1
- fix to engine.process_defaults so it works correctly with a table that has 
different column name/column keys (changset 982)
- a column can only be attached to one table - this is now asserted
- postgres time types descend from Time type
- fix to alltests so that it runs types test (now named testtypes)
- fix to Join object so that it correctly exports its foreign keys (cs 973)
- creating relationships against mappers that use inheritance fixed (cs 973)

0.1.0
