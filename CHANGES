0.1.4
- create_engine() now uses genericized parameters; host/hostname, db/dbname/database, 
password/passwd, etc. for all engine connections. makes engine URIs much more "universal"
- added support for SELECT statements embedded into a column clause, using the flag
"scalar=True"
- another overhaul to EagerLoading when used in conjunction with mappers that
inherit; improvements to eager loads figuring out their aliased queries
correctly, also relations set up against a mapper with inherited mappers will
create joins against the table that is specific to the mapper itself (i.e. and
not any tables that are inherited/are further down the inheritance chain),
this can be overridden by using custom primary/secondary joins.
- added J.Ellis patch to mapper.py so that selectone() throws an exception 
if query returns more than one object row, selectfirst() to not throw the 
exception. also adds selectfirst_by (synonymous with get_by) and selectone_by
- added onupdate parameter to Column, will exec SQL/python upon an update
statement.Also adds "for_update=True" to all DefaultGenerator subclasses
- added support for Oracle table reflection contributed by Andrija Zaric; 
still some bugs to work out regarding composite primary keys/dictionary selection
- checked in an initial Firebird module, awaiting testing.
- added sql.ClauseParameters dictionary object as the result for 
compiled.get_params(), does late-typeprocessing of bind parameters so 
that the original values are easier to access
- more docs for indexes, column defaults, connection pooling, engine construction
- overhaul to the construction of the types system.  uses a simpler inheritance pattern
so that any of the generic types can be easily subclassed, with no need for TypeDecorator.
- added "convert_unicode=False" parameter to SQLEngine, will cause all String types to 
perform unicode encoding/decoding (makes Strings act like Unicodes)
- added 'encoding="utf8"' parameter to engine.  the given encoding will be 
used for all encode/decode calls within Unicode types as well as Strings 
when convert_unicode=True.
- improved support for mapping against UNIONs, added polymorph.py example
to illustrate multi-class mapping against a UNION
- fix to SQLite LIMIT/OFFSET syntax
- fix to Oracle LIMIT syntax
- added backref() function, allows backreferences to have keyword arguments
that will be passed to the backref.
- Sequences and ColumnDefault objects can do execute()/scalar() standalone
- SQL functions (i.e. func.foo()) can do execute()/scalar() standalone
- fix to SQL functions so that the ANSI-standard functions, i.e. current_timestamp
etc., do not specify parenthesis.  all other functions do.
- added settattr_clean and append_clean to SmartProperty, which set 
attributes without triggering a "dirty" event or any history. used as:
myclass.prop1.setattr_clean(myobject, 'hi')
- improved support to column defaults when used by mappers; mappers will pull
pre-executed defaults from statement's executed bind parameters
(pre-conversion) to populate them into a saved object's attributes; if any
PassiveDefaults have fired off, will instead post-fetch the row from the DB to
populate the object.
- added 'get_session().invalidate(*obj)' method to objectstore, instances will
refresh() themselves upon the next attribute access.
- improvements to SQL func calls including an "engine" keyword argument so
they can be execute()d or scalar()ed standalone, also added func accessor to
SQLEngine
- fix to MySQL4 custom table engines, i.e. TYPE instead of ENGINE
- slightly enhanced logging, includes timestamps and a somewhat configurable
formatting system, in lieu of a full-blown logging system
- improvements to the ActiveMapper class from the TG gang, including
many-to-many relationships
- added Double and TinyInt support to mysql

0.1.3
- completed "post_update" feature, will add a second update statement before
inserts and after deletes in order to reconcile a relationship without any
dependencies being created; used when persisting two rows that are dependent
on each other
- completed mapper.using(session) function, localized per-object Session
functionality; objects can be declared and manipulated as local to any
user-defined Session
- fix to Oracle "row_number over" clause with multiple tables
- mapper.get() was not selecting multiple-keyed objects if the mapper's table was a join,
such as in an inheritance relationship, this is fixed.
- overhaul to sql/schema packages so that the sql package can run all on its own,
producing selects, inserts, etc. without any engine dependencies.  builds upon
new TableClause/ColumnClause lexical objects.  Schema's Table/Column objects
are the "physical" subclasses of them.  simplifies schema/sql relationship,
extensions (like proxyengine), and speeds overall performance by a large margin. 
removes the entire getattr() behavior that plagued 0.1.1.
- refactoring of how the mapper "synchronizes" data between two objects into a
separate module, works better with properties attached to a mapper that has an 
additional inheritance relationship to one of the related tables, also the same
methodology used to synchronize parent/child objects now used by mapper to
synchronize between inherited and inheriting mappers.
- made objectstore "check for out-of-identitymap" more aggressive, will perform the
check when object attributes are modified or the object is deleted
- Index object fully implemented, can be constructed standalone, or via
"index" and "unique" arguments on Columns.
- added "convert_unicode" flag to SQLEngine, will treat all String/CHAR types
as Unicode types, with raw-byte/utf-8 translation on the bind parameter and 
result set side.
- postgres maintains a list of ANSI functions that must have no parenthesis so
function calls with no arguments work consistently
- tables can be created with no engine specified.  this will default their engine
to a module-scoped "default engine" which is a ProxyEngine.  this engine can 
be connected via the function "global_connect".
- added "refresh(*obj)" method to objectstore / Session to reload the attributes of
any set of objects from the database unconditionally

0.1.2
- fixed a recursive call in schema that was somehow running 994 times then returning
normally.  broke nothing, slowed down everything.  thanks to jpellerin for finding this.

0.1.1
- small fix to Function class so that expressions with a func.foo() use the type of the
Function object (i.e. the left side) as the type of the boolean expression, not the 
other side which is more of a moving target (changeset 1020).
- creating self-referring mappers with backrefs slightly easier (but still not that easy -
changeset 1019)
- fixes to one-to-one mappings (changeset 1015)
- psycopg1 date/time issue with None fixed (changeset 1005)
- two issues related to postgres, which doesnt want to give you the "lastrowid"
since oids are deprecated:
   * postgres database-side defaults that are on primary key cols *do* execute 
explicitly beforehand, even though thats not the idea of a PassiveDefault.  this is
because sequences on columns get reflected as PassiveDefaults, but need to be explicitly
executed on a primary key col so we know what we just inserted.  
   * if you did add a row that has a bunch of database-side defaults on it, 
and the PassiveDefault thing was working the old way, i.e. they just execute on 
the DB side, the "cant get the row back without an OID" exception that occurred
also will not happen unless someone (usually the ORM) explicitly asks for it.
- fixed a glitch with engine.execute_compiled where it was making a second 
ResultProxy that just got thrown away.
- began to implement newer logic in object properities.  you can now say
myclass.attr.property, which will give you the PropertyLoader corresponding to that
attribute, i.e. myclass.mapper.props['attr']
- eager loading has been internally overhauled to use aliases at all times.  more 
complicated chains of eager loads can now be created without any need for explicit
"use aliases"-type instructions.  EagerLoader code is also much simpler now.
- a new somewhat experimental flag "use_update" added to relations, indicates that 
this relationship should be handled by a second UPDATE statement, either after a 
primary INSERT or before a primary DELETE.  handles circular row dependencies.
- added exceptions module, all raised exceptions (except for some 
KeyError/AttributeError exceptions) descend from these classes.
- fix to date types with MySQL, returned timedelta converted to datetime.time
- two-phase objectstore.commit operations (i.e. begin/commit) now return a 
transactional object (SessionTrans), to more clearly indicate transaction boundaries.
- Index object with create/drop support added to schema
- fix to postgres, where it will explicitly pre-execute a PassiveDefault on a table
if it is a primary key column, pursuant to the ongoing "we cant get inserted rows 
back from postgres" issue
- change to information_schema query that gets back postgres table defs, now
uses explicit JOIN keyword, since one user had faster performance with 8.1
- fix to engine.process_defaults so it works correctly with a table that has 
different column name/column keys (changset 982)
- a column can only be attached to one table - this is now asserted
- postgres time types descend from Time type
- fix to alltests so that it runs types test (now named testtypes)
- fix to Join object so that it correctly exports its foreign keys (cs 973)
- creating relationships against mappers that use inheritance fixed (cs 973)
