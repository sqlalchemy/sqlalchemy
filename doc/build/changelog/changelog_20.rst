.. changelog::
    :version: 2.0.0b4
    :released: December 5, 2022

    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, orm
        :tickets: 8859

        Added support custom user-defined types which extend the Python
        ``enum.Enum`` base class to be resolved automatically
        to SQLAlchemy :class:`.Enum` SQL types, when using the Annotated
        Declarative Table feature.  The feature is made possible through new
        lookup features added to the ORM type map feature, and includes support
        for changing the arguments of the :class:`.Enum` that's generated by
        default as well as setting up specific ``enum.Enum`` types within
        the map with specific arguments.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, typing
        :tickets: 8783

        Adjusted internal use of the Python ``enum.IntFlag`` class which changed
        its behavioral contract in Python 3.11. This was not causing runtime
        failures however caused typing runs to fail under Python 3.11.

    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, typing
        :tickets: 8847

        Added a new type :class:`.SQLColumnExpression` which may be indicated in
        user code to represent any SQL column oriented expression, including both
        those based on :class:`.ColumnElement` as well as on ORM
        :class:`.QueryableAttribute`. This type is a real class, not an alias, so
        can also be used as the foundation for other objects.  An additional
        ORM-specific subclass :class:`.SQLORMExpression` is also included.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, typing
        :tickets: 8667, 6810

        The ``sqlalchemy.ext.mutable`` extension and ``sqlalchemy.ext.automap``
        extensions are now fully pep-484 typed. Huge thanks to Gleb Kisenkov for
        their efforts on this.



    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 8849

        The approach to the ``numeric`` pep-249 paramstyle has been rewritten, and
        is now fully supported, including by features such as "expanding IN" and
        "insertmanyvalues". Parameter names may also be repeated in the source SQL
        construct which will be correctly represented within the numeric format
        using a single parameter. Introduced an additional numeric paramstyle
        called ``numeric_dollar``, which is specifically what's used by the asyncpg
        dialect; the paramstyle is equivalent to ``numeric`` except numeric
        indicators are indicated by a dollar-sign rather than a colon. The asyncpg
        dialect now uses ``numeric_dollar`` paramstyle directly, rather than
        compiling to ``format`` style first.

        The ``numeric`` and ``numeric_dollar`` paramstyles assume that the target
        backend is capable of receiving the numeric parameters in any order,
        and will match the given parameter values to the statement based on
        matching their position (1-based) to the numeric indicator.  This is the
        normal behavior of "numeric" paramstyles, although it was observed that
        the SQLite DBAPI implements a not-used "numeric" style that does not honor
        parameter ordering.

    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, postgresql
        :tickets: 8765

        Complementing :ticket:`8690`, new comparison methods such as
        :meth:`_postgresql.Range.adjacent_to`,
        :meth:`_postgresql.Range.difference`, :meth:`_postgresql.Range.union`,
        etc., were added to the PG-specific range objects, bringing them in par
        with the standard operators implemented by the underlying
        :attr:`_postgresql.AbstractRange.comparator_factory`.

        In addition, the ``__bool__()`` method of the class has been corrected to
        be consistent with the common Python containers behavior as well as how
        other popular PostgreSQL drivers do: it now tells whether the range
        instance is *not* empty, rather than the other way around.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 8770

        Adjusted the rendering of ``RETURNING``, in particular when using
        :class:`_sql.Insert`, such that it now renders columns using the same logic
        as that of the :class:`.Select` construct to generate labels, which will
        include disambiguating labels, as well as that a SQL function surrounding a
        named column will be labeled using the column name itself. This establishes
        better cross-compatibility when selecting rows from either :class:`.Select`
        constructs or from DML statements that use :meth:`.UpdateBase.returning`. A
        narrower scale change was also made for the 1.4 series that adjusted the
        function label issue only.

    .. change::
        :tags: change, postgresql, asyncpg
        :tickets: 8926

        Changed the paramstyle used by asyncpg from ``format`` to
        ``numeric_dollar``. This has two main benefits since it does not require
        additional processing of the statement and allows for duplicate parameters
        to be present in the statements.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 8888

        Fixed issue where use of an unknown datatype within a :class:`.Mapped`
        annotation for a column-based attribute would silently fail to map the
        attribute, rather than reporting an exception; an informative exception
        message is now raised.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 8777

        Fixed a suite of issues involving :class:`.Mapped` use with dictionary
        types, such as ``Mapped[dict[str, str] | None]``, would not be correctly
        interpreted in Declarative ORM mappings. Support to correctly
        "de-optionalize" this type including for lookup in ``type_annotation_map``
        has been fixed.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm
        :tickets: 8822

        Added a new parameter :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.use_existing_column` to
        accommodate the use case of a single-table inheritance mapping that uses
        the pattern of more than one subclass indicating the same column to take
        place on the superclass. This pattern was previously possible by using
        :func:`_orm.declared_attr` in conjunction with locating the existing column
        in the ``.__table__`` of the superclass, however is now updated to work
        with :func:`_orm.mapped_column` as well as with pep-484 typing, in a
        simple and succinct way.

           :ref:`orm_inheritance_column_conflicts`




    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mssql
        :tickets: 8917

        Fixed regression caused by the combination of :ticket:`8177`, re-enable
        setinputsizes for SQL server unless fast_executemany + DBAPI executemany is
        used for a statement, along with :ticket:`6047`, implement
        "insertmanyvalues", which bypasses DBAPI executemany in place of a custom
        DBAPI execute for INSERT statements. setinputsizes would incorrectly not be
        used for a multiple parameter-set INSERT statement that used
        "insertmanyvalues" if fast_executemany were turned on, as the check would
        incorrectly assume this is a DBAPI executemany call.  The "regression"
        would then be that the "insertmanyvalues" statement format is apparently
        slightly more sensitive to multiple rows that don't use the same types
        for each row, so in such a case setinputsizes is especially needed.

        The fix repairs the fast_executemany check so that it only disables
        setinputsizes if true DBAPI executemany is to be used.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, performance
        :tickets: 8796

        Additional performance enhancements within ORM-enabled SQL statements,
        specifically targeting callcounts within the construction of ORM
        statements, using combinations of :func:`_orm.aliased` with
        :func:`_sql.union` and similar "compound" constructs, in addition to direct
        performance improvements to the ``corresponding_column()`` internal method
        that is used heavily by the ORM by constructs like :func:`_orm.aliased` and
        similar.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, postgresql
        :tickets: 8884

        Added additional type-detection for the new PostgreSQL
        :class:`_postgresql.Range` type, where previous cases that allowed the
        psycopg2-native range objects to be received directly by the DBAPI without
        SQLAlchemy intercepting them stopped working, as we now have our own value
        object. The :class:`_postgresql.Range` object has been enhanced such that
        SQLAlchemy Core detects it in otherwise ambiguous situations (such as
        comparison to dates) and applies appropriate bind handlers. Pull request
        courtesy Lele Gaifax.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 8880

        Fixed bug in :ref:`orm_declarative_native_dataclasses` feature where using
        plain dataclass fields with the ``__allow_unmapped__`` directive in a
        mapping would not create a dataclass with the correct class-level state for
        those fields, copying the raw ``Field`` object to the class inappropriately
        after dataclasses itself had replaced the ``Field`` object with the
        class-level default value.

    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, orm extensions
        :tickets: 8878

        Added support for the :func:`.association_proxy` extension function to
        take part within Python ``dataclasses`` configuration, when using
        the native dataclasses feature described at
        :ref:`orm_declarative_native_dataclasses`.  Included are attribute-level
        arguments including :paramref:`.association_proxy.init` and
        :paramref:`.association_proxy.default_factory`.

        Documentation for association proxy has also been updated to use
        "Annotated Declarative Table" forms within examples, including type
        annotations used for :class:`.AssocationProxy` itself.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, typing

        Corrected typing support for the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary`
        argument which may also accept a callable (lambda) that returns a
        :class:`.FromClause`.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, regression
        :tickets: 8812

        Fixed regression where flushing a mapped class that's mapped against a
        subquery, such as a direct mapping or some forms of concrete table
        inheritance, would fail if the :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.eager_defaults`
        parameter were used.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, schema
        :tickets: 8925

        Stricter rules are in place for appending of :class:`.Column` objects to
        :class:`.Table` objects, both moving some previous deprecation warnings to
        exceptions, and preventing some previous scenarios that would cause
        duplicate columns to appear in tables, when
        :paramref:`.Table.extend_existing` were set to ``True``, for both
        programmatic :class:`.Table` construction as well as during reflection
        operations.

        See :ref:`change_8925` for a rundown of these changes.

    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, orm
        :tickets: 8905

        Added :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.compare` parameter to relevant ORM
        attribute constructs including :func:`_orm.mapped_column`,
        :func:`_orm.relationship` etc. to provide for the Python dataclasses
        ``compare`` parameter on ``field()``, when using the
        :ref:`orm_declarative_native_dataclasses` feature. Pull request courtesy
        Simon Schiele.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, usecase
        :tickets: 6289

        Added :class:`_expression.ScalarValues` that can be used as a column
        element allowing using :class:`_expression.Values` inside ``IN`` clauses
        or in conjunction with ``ANY`` or ``ALL`` collection aggregates.
        This new class is generated using the method
        :meth:`_expression.Values.scalar_values`.
        The :class:`_expression.Values` instance is now coerced to a
        :class:`_expression.ScalarValues` when used in a ``IN`` or ``NOT IN``
        operation.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 8853

        Fixed regression in 2.0.0b3 caused by :ticket:`8759` where indicating the
        :class:`.Mapped` name using a qualified name such as
        ``sqlalchemy.orm.Mapped`` would fail to be recognized by Declarative as
        indicating the :class:`.Mapped` construct.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, typing
        :tickets: 8842

        Improved the typing for :class:`.sessionmaker` and
        :class:`.async_sessionmaker`, so that the default type of their return value
        will be :class:`.Session` or :class:`.AsyncSession`, without the need to
        type this explicitly. Previously, Mypy would not automaticaly infer these
        return types from its generic base.

        As part of this change, arguments for :class:`.Session`,
        :class:`.AsyncSession`, :class:`.sessionmaker` and
        :class:`.async_sessionmaker` beyond the initial "bind" argument have been
        made keyword-only, which includes parameters that have always been
        documented as keyword arguments, such as :paramref:`.Session.autoflush`,
        :paramref:`.Session.class_`, etc.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, typing
        :tickets: 8776

        Fixed issue where passing a callbale function returning an iterable
        of column elements to :paramref:`_orm.relationship.order_by` was
        flagged as an error in type checkers.

.. changelog::
    :version: 2.0.0b3
    :released: November 4, 2022

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, declarative
        :tickets: 8759

        Added support in ORM declarative annotations for class names specified for
        :func:`_orm.relationship`, as well as the name of the :class:`_orm.Mapped`
        symbol itself, to be different names than their direct class name, to
        support scenarios such as where :class:`_orm.Mapped` is imported as
        ``from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped as M``, or where related class names
        are imported with an alternate name in a similar fashion. Additionally, a
        target class name given as the lead argument for :func:`_orm.relationship`
        will always supersede the name given in the left hand annotation, so that
        otherwise un-importable names that also don't match the class name can
        still be used in annotations.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, declarative
        :tickets: 8692

        Improved support for legacy 1.4 mappings that use annotations which don't
        include ``Mapped[]``, by ensuring the ``__allow_unmapped__`` attribute can
        be used to allow such legacy annotations to pass through Annotated
        Declarative without raising an error and without being interpreted in an
        ORM runtime context. Additionally improved the error message generated when
        this condition is detected, and added more documentation for how this
        situation should be handled. Unfortunately the 1.4 WARN_SQLALCHEMY_20
        migration warning cannot detect this particular configurational issue at
        runtime with its current architecture.

    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, postgresql
        :tickets: 8690

        Refined the new approach to range objects described at :ref:`change_7156`
        to accommodate driver-specific range and multirange objects, to better
        accommodate both legacy code as well as when passing results from raw SQL
        result sets back into new range or multirange expressions.

    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, engine
        :tickets: 8717

        Added new parameter :paramref:`.PoolEvents.reset.reset_state` parameter to
        the :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset` event, with deprecation logic in place that
        will continue to accept event hooks using the previous set of arguments.
        This indicates various state information about how the reset is taking
        place and is used to allow custom reset schemes to take place with full
        context given.

        Within this change a fix that's also backported to 1.4 is included which
        re-enables the :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset` event to continue to take place
        under all circumstances, including when :class:`.Connection` has already
        "reset" the connection.

        The two changes together allow custom reset schemes to be implemented using
        the :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset` event, instead of the
        :meth:`.PoolEvents.checkin` event (which continues to function as it always
        has).

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, declarative
        :tickets: 8705

        Changed a fundamental configuration behavior of :class:`.Mapper`, where
        :class:`_schema.Column` objects that are explicitly present in the
        :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.properties` dictionary, either directly or enclosed
        within a mapper property object, will now be mapped within the order of how
        they appear within the mapped :class:`.Table` (or other selectable) itself
        (assuming they are in fact part of that table's list of columns), thereby
        maintaining the same order of columns in the mapped selectable as is
        instrumented on the mapped class, as well as what renders in an ORM SELECT
        statement for that mapper. Previously (where "previously" means since
        version 0.0.1), :class:`.Column` objects in the
        :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.properties` dictionary would always be mapped first,
        ahead of when the other columns in the mapped :class:`.Table` would be
        mapped, causing a discrepancy in the order in which the mapper would
        assign attributes to the mapped class as well as the order in which they
        would render in statements.

        The change most prominently takes place in the way that Declarative
        assigns declared columns to the :class:`.Mapper`, specifically how
        :class:`.Column` (or :func:`_orm.mapped_column`) objects are handled
        when they have a DDL name that is explicitly different from the mapped
        attribute name, as well as when constructs such as :func:`_orm.deferred`
        etc. are used.   The new behavior will see the column ordering within
        the mapped :class:`.Table` being the same order in which the attributes
        are mapped onto the class, assigned within the :class:`.Mapper` itself,
        and rendered in ORM statements such as SELECT statements, independent
        of how the :class:`_schema.Column` was configured against the
        :class:`.Mapper`.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, engine
        :tickets: 8710

        To better support the use case of iterating :class:`.Result` and
        :class:`.AsyncResult` objects where user-defined exceptions may interrupt
        the iteration, both objects as well as variants such as
        :class:`.ScalarResult`, :class:`.MappingResult`,
        :class:`.AsyncScalarResult`, :class:`.AsyncMappingResult` now support
        context manager usage, where the result will be closed at the end of
        the context manager block.

        In addition, ensured that all the above
        mentioned :class:`.Result` objects include a :meth:`.Result.close` method
        as well as :attr:`.Result.closed` accessors, including
        :class:`.ScalarResult` and :class:`.MappingResult` which previously did
        not have a ``.close()`` method.

        packages.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, declarative
        :tickets: 8718

        Fixed issue in new dataclass mapping feature where a column declared on the
        decalrative base / abstract base / mixin would leak into the constructor
        for an inheriting subclass under some circumstances.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm declarative
        :tickets: 8742

        Fixed issues within the declarative typing resolver (i.e. which resolves
        ``ForwardRef`` objects) where types that were declared for columns in one
        particular source file would raise ``NameError`` when the ultimate mapped
        class were in another source file.  The types are now resolved in terms
        of the module for each class in which the types are used.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, postgresql
        :tickets: 8706

        Added new methods :meth:`_postgresql.Range.contains` and
        :meth:`_postgresql.Range.contained_by` to the new :class:`.Range` data
        object, which mirror the behavior of the PostgreSQL ``@>`` and ``<@``
        operators, as well as the
        :meth:`_postgresql.AbstractRange.comparator_factory.contains` and
        :meth:`_postgresql.AbstractRange.comparator_factory.contained_by` SQL
        operator methods. Pull request courtesy Lele Gaifax.

.. changelog::
    :version: 2.0.0b2
    :released: October 20, 2022

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 8656

        Removed the warning that emits when using ORM-enabled update/delete
        regarding evaluation of columns by name, first added in :ticket:`4073`;
        this warning actually covers up a scenario that otherwise could populate
        the wrong Python value for an ORM mapped attribute depending on what the
        actual column is, so this deprecated case is removed. In 2.0, ORM enabled
        update/delete uses "auto" for "synchronize_session", which should do the
        right thing automatically for any given UPDATE expression.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, mssql
        :tickets: 8661

        Fixed regression caused by SQL Server pyodbc change :ticket:`8177` where we
        now use ``setinputsizes()`` by default; for VARCHAR, this fails if the
        character size is greater than 4000 (or 2000, depending on data) characters
        as the incoming datatype is NVARCHAR, which has a limit of 4000 characters,
        despite the fact that VARCHAR can handle unlimited characters. Additional
        pyodbc-specific typing information is now passed to ``setinputsizes()``
        when the datatype's size is > 2000 characters. The change is also applied
        to the :class:`_types.JSON` type which was also impacted by this issue for large
        JSON serializations.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, typing

        Fixed typing issue where pylance strict mode would report "instance
        variable overrides class variable" when using a method to define
        ``__tablename__``, ``__mapper_args__`` or ``__table_args__``.

        :tickets: 7211

        The :class:`.Sequence` construct restores itself to the DDL behavior it
        had prior to the 1.4 series, where creating a :class:`.Sequence` with
        no additional arguments will emit a simple ``CREATE SEQUENCE`` instruction
        **without** any additional parameters for "start value".   For most backends,
        this is how things worked previously in any case; **however**, for
        MS SQL Server, the default value on this database is
        ``-2**63``; to prevent this generally impractical default
        from taking effect on SQL Server, the :paramref:`.Sequence.start` parameter
        should be provided.   As usage of :class:`.Sequence` is unusual
        for SQL Server which for many years has standardized on ``IDENTITY``,
        it is hoped that this change has minimal impact.

        :tickets: 8665

        Improved the :class:`.DeclarativeBase` class so that when combined with
        other mixins like :class:`.MappedAsDataclass`, the order of the classes may
        be in either order.


    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, declarative, orm
        :tickets: 8665

        Added support for mapped classes that are also ``Generic`` subclasses,
        to be specified as a ``GenericAlias`` object (e.g. ``MyClass[str]``)
        within statements and calls to :func:`_sa.inspect`.



    .. change::

        :tickets: 8668

        Fixed bug in new ORM typed declarative mappings where the ability
        to use ``Optional[MyClass]`` or similar forms such as ``MyClass | None``
        in the type annotation for a many-to-one relationship was not implemented,
        leading to errors.   Documentation has also been added for this use
        case to the relationship configuration documentation.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, regression, sql
        :tickets: 8639

        Fixed bug in new "insertmanyvalues" feature where INSERT that included a
        subquery with :func:`_sql.bindparam` inside of it would fail to render
        correctly in "insertmanyvalues" format. This affected psycopg2 most
        directly as "insertmanyvalues" is used unconditionally with this driver.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, declarative

        Fixed issue with new dataclass mapping feature where arguments passed to

        that override :func:`_orm.mapped_column` declarations, leading to
        initializer problems.

        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 7888

        The FROM clauses that are established on a :func:`_sql.select` construct
        when using the :meth:`_sql.Select.select_from` method will now render first
        in the FROM clause of the rendered SELECT, which serves to maintain the
        ordering of clauses as was passed to the :meth:`_sql.Select.select_from`
        method itself without being affected by the presence of those clauses also
        being mentioned in other parts of the query. If other elements of the
        :class:`_sql.Select` also generate FROM clauses, such as the columns clause
        or WHERE clause, these will render after the clauses delivered by
        :meth:`_sql.Select.select_from` assuming they were not explictly passed to
        :meth:`_sql.Select.select_from` also. This improvement is useful in those
        cases where a particular database generates a desirable query plan based on
        a particular ordering of FROM clauses and allows full control over the
        ordering of FROM clauses.

    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, sql
        :tickets: 7998

        Altered the compilation mechanics of the :class:`_dml.Insert` construct
        such that the "autoincrement primary key" column value will be fetched via
        ``cursor.lastrowid`` or RETURNING even if present in the parameter set or
        within the :meth:`_dml.Insert.values` method as a plain bound value, for
        single-row INSERT statements on specific backends that are known to
        generate autoincrementing values even when explicit NULL is passed. This
        restores a behavior that was in the 1.3 series for both the use case of
        separate parameter set as well as :meth:`_dml.Insert.values`. In 1.4, the
        parameter set behavior unintentionally changed to no longer do this, but
        the :meth:`_dml.Insert.values` method would still fetch autoincrement
        values up until 1.4.21 where :ticket:`6770` changed the behavior yet again
        again unintentionally as this use case was never covered.

        The behavior is now defined as "working" to suit the case where databases
        such as SQLite, MySQL and MariaDB will ignore an explicit NULL primary key
        value and nonetheless invoke an autoincrement generator.

    .. change::
        :tags: change, postgresql

        SQLAlchemy now requires PostgreSQL version 9 or greater.
        Older versions may still work in some limited use cases.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm

        Fixed issue where the :meth:`_orm.registry.map_declaratively` method
        would return an internal "mapper config" object and not the
        :class:`.Mapper` object as stated in the API documentation.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 7463

        Fixed performance regression which appeared at least in version 1.3 if not
        earlier (sometime after 1.0) where the loading of deferred columns, those
        explicitly mapped with :func:`_orm.defer` as opposed to non-deferred
        columns that were expired, from a joined inheritance subclass would not use
        the "optimized" query which only queried the immediate table that contains
        the unloaded columns, instead running a full ORM query which would emit a
        JOIN for all base tables, which is not necessary when only loading columns
        from the subclass.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 7791

        The :paramref:`.Enum.length` parameter, which sets the length of the
        ``VARCHAR`` column for non-native enumeration types, is now used
        unconditionally when emitting DDL for the ``VARCHAR`` datatype, including
        when the :paramref:`.Enum.native_enum` parameter is set to ``True`` for
        target backends that continue to use ``VARCHAR``. Previously the parameter
        would be erroneously ignored in this case. The warning previously emitted
        for this case is now removed.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 6986

        The internals for the :class:`_orm.Load` object and related loader strategy
        patterns have been mostly rewritten, to take advantage of the fact that
        only attribute-bound paths, not strings, are now supported. The rewrite
        hopes to make it more straightforward to address new use cases and subtle
        issues within the loader strategy system going forward.

    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, orm

        Added :paramref:`_orm.load_only.raiseload` parameter to the
        :func:`_orm.load_only` loader option, so that the unloaded attributes may
        have "raise" behavior rather than lazy loading. Previously there wasn't
        really a way to do this with the :func:`_orm.load_only` option directly.

    .. change::
        :tags: change, engine
        :tickets: 7122

        Some small API changes regarding engines and dialects:

        * The :meth:`.Dialect.set_isolation_level`, :meth:`.Dialect.get_isolation_level`,
          :meth:
          dialect methods will always be passed the raw DBAPI connection

        * The :class:`.Connection` and :class:`.Engine` classes no longer share a base
          ``Connectable`` superclass, which has been removed.

        * Added a new interface class :class:`.PoolProxiedConnection` - this is the
          public facing interface for the familiar :class:`._ConnectionFairy`
          class which is nonetheless a private class.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, sql
        :tickets: 3482

          Added long-requested case-insensitive string operators
          :meth:`_sql.ColumnOperators.icontains`,
          :meth:`_sql.ColumnOperators.istartswith`,
          :meth:`_sql.ColumnOperators.iendswith`, which produce case-insensitive
          LIKE compositions (using ILIKE on PostgreSQL, and the LOWER() function on
          all other backends) to complement the existing LIKE composition operators
          :meth:`_sql.ColumnOperators.contains`,
          :meth:`_sql.ColumnOperators.startswith`, etc. Huge thanks to Matias
          Martinez Rebori for their meticulous and complete efforts in implementing
          these new methods.

    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, postgresql
        :tickets: 8138

        Added literal type rendering for the :class:`_sqltypes.ARRAY` and
        :class:`_postgresql.ARRAY` datatypes. The generic stringify will render
        using brackets, e.g. ``[1, 2, 3]`` and the PostgreSQL specific will use the
        ARRAY literal e.g. ``ARRAY[1, 2, 3]``.   Multiple dimensions and quoting
        are also taken into account.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 8166

        Made an improvement to the "deferred" / "load_only" set of strategy options
        where if a certain object is loaded from two different logical paths within
        one query, attributes that have been configured by at least one of the
        options to be populated will be populated in all cases, even if other load
        paths for that same object did not set this option. previously, it was
        based on randomness as to which "path" addressed the object first.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm, sql
        :tickets: 6047

        Added new feature to all included dialects that support RETURNING
        called "insertmanyvalues".  This is a generalization of the
        "fast executemany" feature first introduced for the psycopg2 driver
        in 1.4 at :ref:`change_5263`, which allows the ORM to batch INSERT
        statements into a much more efficient SQL structure while still being
        able to fetch newly generated primary key and SQL default values
        using RETURNING.

        The feature now applies to the many dialects that support RETURNING along
        with multiple VALUES constructs for INSERT, including all PostgreSQL
        drivers, SQLite, MariaDB, MS SQL Server. Separately, the Oracle dialect
        also gains the same capability using native cx_Oracle or OracleDB features.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, pool
        :tickets: 8523

        The :class:`_pool.QueuePool` now ignores ``max_overflow`` when
        ``pool_size=0``, properly making the pool unlimited in all cases.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 7909

        The in-place type detection for Python integers, as occurs with an
        expression such as ``literal(25)``, will now apply value-based adaption as
        well to accommodate Python large integers, where the datatype determined
        will be :class:`.BigInteger` rather than :class:`.Integer`. This
        accommodates for dialects such as that of asyncpg which both sends implicit
        typing information to the driver as well as is sensitive to numeric scale.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql, mssql, change
        :tickets: 7225

        The parameter :paramref:`_types.UUID.as_uuid` of :class:`_types.UUID`,
        previously specific to the PostgreSQL dialect but now generalized for Core
        (along with a new backend-agnostic :class:`_types.Uuid` datatype) now
        defaults to ``True``, indicating that Python ``UUID`` objects are accepted
        by this datatype by default. Additionally, the SQL Server
        :class:`_mssql.UNIQUEIDENTIFIER` datatype has been converted to be a
        UUID-receiving type; for legacy code that makes use of
        :class:`_mssql.UNIQUEIDENTIFIER` using string values, set the
        :paramref:`_mssql.UNIQUEIDENTIFIER.as_uuid` parameter to ``False``.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 8344

        Fixed issue in ORM enabled UPDATE when the statement is created against a
        joined-inheritance subclass, updating only local table columns, where the
        "fetch" synchronization strategy would not render the correct RETURNING
        clause for databases that use RETURNING for fetch synchronization.
        Also adjusts the strategy used for RETURNING in UPDATE FROM and
        DELETE FROM statements.

    .. change::
        :tags: usecase, mariadb
        :tickets: 8344

        Added a new execution option ``is_delete_using=True``, which is consumed
        by the ORM when using an ORM-enabled DELETE statement in conjunction with
        the "fetch" synchronization strategy; this option indicates that the
        DELETE statement is expected to use multiple tables, which on MariaDB
        is the DELETE..USING syntax.   The option then indicates that
        RETURNING (newly implemented in SQLAlchemy 2.0 for MariaDB
        for  :ticket:`7011`) should not be used for databases that are known
        to not support "DELETE..USING..RETURNING" syntax, even though they
        support "DELETE..USING", which is MariaDB's current capability.

        The rationale for this option is that the current workings of ORM-enabled
        DELETE doesn't know up front if a DELETE statement is against multiple
        tables or not until compilation occurs, which is cached in any case, yet it
        needs to be known so that a SELECT for the to-be-deleted row can be emitted
        up front. Instead of applying an across-the-board performance penalty for
        all DELETE statements by proactively checking them all for this
        relatively unusual SQL pattern, the ``is_delete_using=True`` execution
        option is requested via a new exception message that is raised
        within the compilation step.  This exception message is specifically
        (and only) raised when:   the statement is an ORM-enabled DELETE where
        the "fetch" synchronization strategy has been requested; the
        backend is MariaDB or other backend with this specific limitation;
        the statement has been detected within the initial compilation
        that it would otherwise emit "DELETE..USING..RETURNING".   By applying
        the execution option, the ORM knows to run a SELECT upfront instead.
        A similar option is implemented for ORM-enabled UPDATE but there is not
        currently a backend where it is needed.



    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm, asyncio
        :tickets: 7703

        Removed the unused ``**kw`` arguments from
        :class:`_asyncio.AsyncSession.begin` and
        :class:`_asyncio.AsyncSession.begin_nested`. These kw aren't used and
        appear to have been added to the API in error.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 8285

        Added new syntax to the :attr:`.FromClause.c` collection on all
        :class:`.FromClause` objects allowing tuples of keys to be passed to
        ``__getitem__()``, along with support for the :func:`_sql.select` construct
        to handle the resulting tuple-like collection directly, allowing the syntax
        ``select(table.c['a', 'b', 'c'])`` to be possible. The sub-collection
        returned is itself a :class:`.ColumnCollection` which is also directly
        consumable by :func:`_sql.select` and similar now.

        :tickets: 7257

        Migrated the codebase to remove all pre-2.0 behaviors and architectures
        that were previously noted as deprecated for removal in 2.0, including,
        but not limited to:

        * removal of all Python 2 code, minimum version is now Python 3.7

        * :class:`_engine.Engine` and :class:`_engine.Connection` now use the
          new 2.0 style of working, which includes "autobegin", library level
          autocommit removed, subtransactions and "branched" connections
          removed

        * Result objects use 2.0-style behaviors; :class:`_result.Row` is fully
          a named tuple without "mapping" behavior, use :class:`_result.RowMapping`
          for "mapping" behavior

        * All Unicode encoding/decoding architecture has been removed from
          SQLAlchemy.  All modern DBAPI implementations support Unicode
          transparently thanks to Python 3, so the ``convert_unicode`` feature
          as well as related mechanisms to look for bytestrings in
          DBAPI ``cursor.description`` etc. have been removed.

        * The ``.bind`` attribute and parameter from :class:`.MetaData`,
          :class:`.Table`, and from all DDL/DML/DQL elements that previously could
          refer to a "bound engine"

        * The standalone ``sqlalchemy.orm.mapper()`` function is removed; all
          classical mapping should be done through the
          :meth:`_orm.registry.map_imperatively` method of :class:`_orm.registry`.

        * The :meth:`_orm.Query.join` method no longer accepts strings for
          relationship names; the long-documented approach of using
          ``Class.attrname`` for join targets is now standard.

        * :meth:`_orm.Query.join` no longer accepts the "aliased" and
          "from_joinpoint" arguments

        * :meth:`_orm.Query.join` no longer accepts chains of multiple join
          targets in one method call.

        * ``Query.from_self()``, ``Query.select_entity_from()`` and
          ``Query.with_polymorphic()`` are removed.

        * The :paramref:`_orm.relationship.cascade_backrefs` parameter must now
          remain at its new default of ``False``; the ``save-update`` cascade
          no longer cascades along a backref.

        * the :paramref:`_orm.Session.future` parameter must always be set to
          ``True``.  2.0-style transactional patterns for :class:`_orm.Session`
          are now always in effect.

        * Loader options no longer accept strings for attribute names.  The
          long-documented approach of using ``Class.attrname`` for loader option
          targets is now standard.

        * Legacy forms of :func:`_sql.select` removed, including
          ``select([cols])``, the "whereclause" and keyword parameters of
          ``some_table.select()``.

        * Legacy "in-place mutator" methods on :class:`_sql.Select` such as
          ``append_whereclause()``, ``append_order_by()`` etc are removed.

        * Removed the very old "dbapi_proxy" module, which in very early
          SQLAlchemy releases was used to provide a transparent connection pool
          over a raw DBAPI connection.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm
        :tickets: 8375

        Added new parameter :paramref:`_orm.AttributeEvents.include_key`, which
        will include the dictionary or list key for operations such as
        ``__setitem__()`` (e.g. ``obj[key] = value``) and ``__delitem__()`` (e.g.
        ``del obj[key]``), using a new keyword parameter "key" or "keys", depending
        on event, e.g. :paramref:`_orm.AttributeEvents.append.key`,
        :paramref:`_orm.AttributeEvents.bulk_replace.keys`. This allows event
        handlers to take into account the key that was passed to the operation and
        is of particular importance for dictionary operations working with
        :class:`_orm.MappedCollection`.


    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql, usecase
        :tickets: 7156, 8540

        Adds support for PostgreSQL multirange types, introduced in PostgreSQL 14.
        Support for PostgreSQL ranges and multiranges has now been generalized to
        the psycopg3, psycopg2 and asyncpg backends, with room for further dialect
        support, using a backend-agnostic :class:`_postgresql.Range` data object
        that's constructor-compatible with the previously used psycopg2 object. See
        the new documentation for usage patterns.

        In addition, range type handling has been enhanced so that it automatically
        renders type casts, so that in-place round trips for statements that don't
        provide the database with any context don't require the :func:`_sql.cast`
        construct to be explicit for the database to know the desired type
        (discussed at :ticket:`8540`).

        Thanks very much to @zeeeeeb for the pull request implementing and testing
        the new datatypes and psycopg support.

        :tickets: 8221

        Oracle will now use FETCH FIRST N ROWS / OFFSET syntax for limit/offset
        support by default for Oracle 12c and above. This syntax was already
        available when :meth:`_sql.Select.fetch` were used directly, it's now
        implied for :meth:`_sql.Select.limit` and :meth:`_sql.Select.offset` as
        well.


    .. change::
        :tags: feature, orm
        :tickets: 3162

        Added new parameter :paramref:`_sql.Operators.op.python_impl`, available
        from :meth:`_sql.Operators.op` and also when using the
        :class:`_sql.Operators.custom_op` constructor directly, which allows an
        in-Python evaluation function to be provided along with the custom SQL
        operator. This evaluation function becomes the implementation used when the
        operator object is used given plain Python objects as operands on both
        sides, and in particular is compatible with the
        ``synchronize_session='evaluate'`` option used with
        :ref:`orm_expression_update_delete`.

        DDL and reflection; the field is added to the base :class:`.Constraint`
        class and corresponding constructors, however PostgreSQL is the only
        included backend to support the feature right now.

        Added new parameter to SQLite for reflection methods called
        ``sqlite_include_internal=True``; when omitted, local tables that start
        with the prefix ``sqlite_``, which per SQLite documentation are noted as
        "internal schema" tables such as the ``sqlite_sequence`` table generated to
        support "AUTOINCREMENT" columns, will not be included in reflection methods
        that return lists of local objects. This prevents issues for example when
        using Alembic autogenerate, which previously would consider these
        SQLite-generated tables as being remove from the model.

        The :paramref:`_postgresql.ENUM.name` parameter for the PostgreSQL-specific

        To better accommodate explicit typing, the names of some ORM constructs
        that are typically constructed internally, but nonetheless are sometimes
        visible in messaging as well as typing, have been changed to more succinct
        names which also match the name of their constructing function (with
        different casing), in all cases maintaining aliases to the old names for
        the forseeable future:

        * :class:`_orm.RelationshipProperty` becomes an alias for the primary name
          :class:`_orm.Relationship`, which is constructed as always from the
          :func:`_orm.relationship` function
        * :class:`_orm.SynonymProperty` becomes an alias for the primary name
          :class:`_orm.Synonym`, constructed as always from the
          :func:`_orm.synonym` function
        * :class:`_orm.CompositeProperty` becomes an alias for the primary name
          :class:`_orm.Composite`, constructed as always from the
          :func:`_orm.composite` function

        For consistency with the prominent ORM concept :class:`_orm.Mapped`, the
        names of the dictionary-oriented collections,
        :func:`_orm.attribute_mapped_collection`,
        :func:`_orm.column_mapped_collection`, and :class:`_orm.MappedCollection`,
        are changed to :func:`_orm.attribute_keyed_dict`,
        :func:`_orm.column_keyed_dict` and :class:`_orm.KeyFuncDict`, using the
        phrase "dict" to minimize any confusion against the term "mapped". The old
        names will remain indefinitely with no schedule for removal.

        :tags: engine, usecase
        :tickets: 6342

        Generalized the :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.isolation_level` parameter to
        the base dialect so that it is no longer dependent on individual dialects
        to be present. This parameter sets up the "isolation level" setting to
        occur for all new database connections as soon as they are created by the
        connection pool, where the value then stays set without being reset on
        every checkin.

        The :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.isolation_level` parameter is essentially
        equivalent in functionality to using the
        :paramref:`_engine.Engine.execution_options.isolation_level` parameter via
        :meth:`_engine.Engine.execution_options` for an engine-wide setting. The
        difference is in that the former setting assigns the isolation level just
        once when a connection is created, the latter sets and resets the given
        level on each connection checkout.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, orm
        :tickets: 8372

        Changed the attribute access method used by
        :func:`_orm.attribute_mapped_collection` and
        :func:`_orm.column_mapped_collection`, used when populating the dictionary,
        to assert that the data value on the object to be used as the dictionary
        key is actually present, and is not instead using "None" due to the
        attribute never being actually assigned. This is used to prevent a
        mis-population of None for a key when assigning via a backref where the
        "key" attribute on the object is not yet assigned.

        As the failure mode here is a transitory condition that is not typically
        persisted to the database, and is easy to produce via the constructor of
        the class based on the order in which parameters are assigned, it is very
        possible that many applications include this behavior already which is
        silently passed over. To accommodate for applications where this error is
        now raised, a new parameter
        :paramref:`_orm.attribute_mapped_collection.ignore_unpopulated_attribute`
        is also added to both :func:`_orm.attribute_mapped_collection` and
        :func:`_orm.column_mapped_collection` that instead causes the erroneous
        backref assignment to be skipped.

        The "ping" query emitted when configuring
        :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.pool_pre_ping` for psycopg, asyncpg and
        pg8000, but not for psycopg2, has been changed to be an empty query (``;``)
        instead of ``SELECT 1``; additionally, for the asyncpg driver, the
        unnecessary use of a prepared statement for this query has been fixed.
        Rationale is to eliminate the need for PostgreSQL to produce a query plan
        when the ping is emitted. The operation is not currently supported by the
        ``psycopg2`` driver which continues to use ``SELECT 1``.

        new state-tracking functionality that will proactively trap any unexpected
        state changes which occur as a particular transactional method proceeds.
        This is to allow situations where the :class:`_orm.Session` is being used
        in a thread-unsafe manner, where event hooks or similar may be calling
        unexpected methods within operations, as well as potentially under other
        concurrency situations such as asyncio or gevent to raise an informative
        message when the illegal access first occurs, rather than passing silently
        leading to secondary failures due to the :class:`_orm.Session` being in an
        invalid state.

        The :func:`_orm.composite` mapping construct now supports automatic

        method is derived from inspection of the dataclass.

        ordering comparison operations, e.g. ``<``, ``>=``, etc.

        dialect dependent, with PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite supporting it,
        and Oracle and SQL Server not supporting it. Third party dialects should
        also seek to ensure their :meth:`_engine.Inspector.has_table` method
        searches for views as well as tables for the given name.

        now participates in the connection pool "pre ping" event for those dialects
        that make use of disconnect codes in order to detect if the database is
        live. This allows end-user code to alter the state of "pre ping". Note that
        this does not include dialects which contain a native "ping" method such as
        that of psycopg2 or most MySQL dialects.

        :tags: feature, orm
        :tickets: 8126

        Added very experimental feature to the :func:`_orm.selectinload` and
        :func:`_orm.immediateload` loader options called
        :paramref:`_orm.selectinload.recursion_depth` /
        :paramref:`_orm.immediateload.recursion_depth` , which allows a single
        loader option to automatically recurse into self-referential relationships.
        Is set to an integer indicating depth, and may also be set to -1 to
        indicate to continue loading until no more levels deep are found.
        Major internal changes to :func:`_orm.selectinload` and
        :func:`_orm.immediateload` allow this feature to work while continuing
        to make correct use of the compilation cache, as well as not using
        arbitrary recursion, so any level of depth is supported (though would
        emit that many queries).  This may be useful for
        self-referential structures that must be loaded fully eagerly, such as when
        using asyncio.

        A warning is also emitted when loader options are connected together with
        arbitrary lengths (that is, without using the new ``recursion_depth``
        option) when excessive recursion depth is detected in related object
        loading. This operation continues to use huge amounts of memory and
        performs extremely poorly; the cache is disabled when this condition is
        detected to protect the cache from being flooded with arbitrary statements.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 8403

        Added new parameter :paramref:`.AbstractConcreteBase.strict_attrs` to the
        :class:`.AbstractConcreteBase` declarative mixin class. The effect of this
        parameter is that the scope of attributes on subclasses is correctly
        limited to the subclass in which each attribute is declared, rather than
        the previous behavior where all attributes of the entire hierarchy are
        applied to the base "abstract" class. This produces a cleaner, more correct
        mapping where subclasses no longer have non-useful attributes on them which
        are only relevant to sibling classes. The default for this parameter is
        False, which leaves the previous behavior unchanged; this is to support
        existing code that makes explicit use of these attributes in queries.
        To migrate to the newer approach, apply explicit attributes to the abstract
        base class as needed.

        :tickets: 6928

        Added new parameter :paramref:`_orm.Session.autobegin`, which when set to
        ``False`` will prevent the :class:`_orm.Session` from beginning a
        transaction implicitly. The :meth:`_orm.Session.begin` method must be
        called explicitly first in order to proceed with operations, otherwise an
        error is raised whenever any operation would otherwise have begun
        automatically. This option can be used to create a "safe"
        :class:`_orm.Session` that won't implicitly start new transactions.

        As part of this change, also added a new status variable
        :class:`_orm.SessionTransaction.origin` which may be useful for event
        handling code to be aware of the origin of a particular
        :class:`_orm.SessionTransaction`.

        Removed the warning that emits from the :class:`_types.Numeric` type about
        DBAPIs not supporting Decimal values natively. This warning was oriented
        towards SQLite, which does not have any real way without additional
        extensions or workarounds of handling precision numeric values more than 15
        significant digits as it only uses floating point math to represent
        numbers. As this is a known and documented limitation in SQLite itself, and
        not a quirk of the pysqlite driver, there's no need for SQLAlchemy to warn
        for this. The change does not otherwise modify how precision numerics are
        handled. Values can continue to be handled as ``Decimal()`` or ``float()``
        as configured with the :class:`_types.Numeric`, :class:`_types.Float` , and
        related datatypes, just without the ability to maintain precision beyond 15
        significant digits when using SQLite, unless alternate representations such
        as strings are used.

        :tickets: 8177

        The ``use_setinputsizes`` parameter for the ``mssql+pyodbc`` dialect now
        defaults to ``True``; this is so that non-unicode string comparisons are
        bound by pyodbc to pyodbc.SQL_VARCHAR rather than pyodbc.SQL_WVARCHAR,
        allowing indexes against VARCHAR columns to take effect. In order for the
        ``fast_executemany=True`` parameter to continue functioning, the
        ``use_setinputsizes`` mode now skips the ``cursor.setinputsizes()`` call
        specifically when ``fast_executemany`` is True and the specific method in
        use is ``cursor.executemany()``, which doesn't support setinputsizes. The
        change also adds appropriate pyodbc DBAPI typing to values that are typed
        as :class:`_types.Unicode` or :class:`_types.UnicodeText`, as well as
        altered the base :class:`_types.JSON` datatype to consider JSON string

        The SQLite dialect now defaults to :class:`_pool.QueuePool` when a file
        based database is used. This is set along with setting the
        ``check_same_thread`` parameter to ``False``. It has been observed that the
        previous approach of defaulting to :class:`_pool.NullPool`, which does not
        hold onto database connections after they are released, did in fact have a
        measurable negative performance impact. As always, the pool class is
        customizable via the :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.poolclass` parameter.

        This phrase is not accepted by all databases and the operation will fail

        fallback within the scope of a single DDL statement.

    .. change::
        :tags: change, postgresql

        In support of new PostgreSQL features including the psycopg3 dialect as
        well as extended "fast insertmany" support, the system by which typing
        information for bound parameters is passed to the PostgreSQL database has
        been redesigned to use inline casts emitted by the SQL compiler, and is now
        applied to all PostgreSQL dialects. This is in contrast to the previous
        approach which would rely upon the DBAPI in use to render these casts
        itself, which in cases such as that of pg8000 and the adapted asyncpg
        driver, would use the pep-249 ``setinputsizes()`` method, or with the
        psycopg2 driver would rely on the driver itself in most cases, with some
        special exceptions made for ARRAY.

        The new approach now has all PostgreSQL dialects rendering these casts as
        needed using PostgreSQL double-colon style within the compiler, and the use
        of ``setinputsizes()`` is removed for PostgreSQL dialects, as this was not
        generally part of these DBAPIs in any case (pg8000 being the only
        exception, which added the method at the request of SQLAlchemy developers).

        Advantages to this approach include per-statement performance, as no second
        pass over the compiled statement is required at execution time, better
        support for all DBAPIs, as there is now one consistent system of applying
        typing information, and improved transparency, as the SQL logging output,
        as well as the string output of a compiled statement, will show these casts
        present in the statement directly, whereas previously these casts were not
        visible in logging output as they would occur after the statement were
        logged.

        column names in Core-only result set rows; it had no effect on the behavior
        of the ORM. The effective behavior of what ``case_sensitive`` refers
        towards remains at its default value of ``True``, meaning that string names
        looked up in ``row._mapping`` will match case-sensitively, just like any
        other Python mapping.

        Note that the ``case_sensitive`` parameter was not in any way related to
        the general subject of case sensitivity control, quoting, and "name
        normalization" (i.e. converting for databases that consider all uppercase
        words to be case insensitive) for DDL identifier names, which remains a
        normal core feature of SQLAlchemy.



    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql
        :tickets: 7744

        Improved the construction of SQL binary expressions to allow for very long
        expressions against the same associative operator without special steps
        needed in order to avoid high memory use and excess recursion depth. A
        particular binary operation ``A op B`` can now be joined against another
        element ``op C`` and the resulting structure will be "flattened" so that
        the representation as well as SQL compilation does not require recursion.

        One effect of this change is that string concatenation expressions which
        use SQL functions come out as "flat", e.g. MySQL will now render
        ``concat('x', 'y', 'z', ...)``` rather than nesting together two-element
        functions like ``concat(concat('x', 'y'), 'z')``.  Third-party dialects
        which override the string concatenation operator will need to implement
        a new method ``def visit_concat_op_expression_clauselist()`` to
        accompany the existing ``def visit_concat_op_binary()`` method.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, types
        :tickets: 5465

        Added :class:`.Double`, :class:`.DOUBLE`, :class:`.DOUBLE_PRECISION`
        datatypes to the base ``sqlalchemy.`` module namespace, for explicit use of
        double/double precision as well as generic "double" datatypes. Use
        :class:`.Double` for generic support that will resolve to DOUBLE/DOUBLE
        PRECISION/FLOAT as needed for different backends.


    .. change::
        :tags: feature, oracle
        :tickets: 5465

        Implemented DDL and reflection support for ``FLOAT`` datatypes which
        include an explicit "binary_precision" value. Using the Oracle-specific
        :class:`_oracle.FLOAT` datatype, the new parameter
        :paramref:`_oracle.FLOAT.binary_precision` may be specified which will
        render Oracle's precision for floating point types directly. This value is
        interpreted during reflection. Upon reflecting back a ``FLOAT`` datatype,
        the datatype returned is one of :class:`_types.DOUBLE_PRECISION` for a
        ``FLOAT`` for a precision of 126 (this is also Oracle's default precision
        for ``FLOAT``), :class:`_types.REAL` for a precision of 63, and
        :class:`_oracle.FLOAT` for a custom precision, as per Oracle documentation.

        As part of this change, the generic :paramref:`_sqltypes.Float.precision`
        value is explicitly rejected when generating DDL for Oracle, as this
        precision cannot be accurately converted to "binary precision"; instead, an
        error message encourages the use of
        :meth:`_sqltypes.TypeEngine.with_variant` so that Oracle's specific form of
        precision may be chosen exactly. This is a backwards-incompatible change in
        behavior, as the previous "precision" value was silently ignored for
        Oracle.

        :tags: deprecations, engine
        :tickets: 6962

        The :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.implicit_returning` parameter is
        deprecated on the :func:`_sa.create_engine` function only; the parameter
        remains available on the :class:`_schema.Table` object. This parameter was
        originally intended to enable the "implicit returning" feature of
        SQLAlchemy when it was first developed and was not enabled by default.
        Under modern use, there's no reason this parameter should be disabled, and
        it has been observed to cause confusion as it degrades performance and
        makes it more difficult for the ORM to retrieve recently inserted server
        defaults. The parameter remains available on :class:`_schema.Table` to
        specifically suit database-level edge cases which make RETURNING
        infeasible, the sole example currently being SQL Server's limitation that
        INSERT RETURNING may not be used on a table that has INSERT triggers on it.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, oracle
        :tickets: 6962

        Related to the deprecation for
        :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.implicit_returning`, the "implicit_returning"
        feature is now enabled for the Oracle dialect in all cases; previously, the
        feature would be turned off when an Oracle 8/8i version were detected,
        however online documentation indicates both versions support the same
        RETURNING syntax as modern versions.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, schema
        :tickets: 8102

        The warnings that are emitted regarding reflection of indexes or unique
        constraints, when the :paramref:`.Table.include_columns` parameter is used
        to exclude columns that are then found to be part of those constraints,
        have been removed. When the :paramref:`.Table.include_columns` parameter is
        used it should be expected that the resulting :class:`.Table` construct
        will not include constraints that rely upon omitted columns. This change
        was made in response to :ticket:`8100` which repaired
        :paramref:`.Table.include_columns` in conjunction with foreign key
        constraints that rely upon omitted columns, where the use case became
        clear that omitting such constraints should be expected.

    .. change::

        The :meth:`.Operators.match` operator now uses ``plainto_tsquery()`` for
        PostgreSQL full text search, rather than ``to_tsquery()``. The rationale
        for this change is to provide better cross-compatibility with match on
        other database backends.    Full support for all PostgreSQL full text
        functions remains available through the use of :data:`.func` in
        conjunction with :meth:`.Operators.bool_op` (an improved version of
        :meth:`.Operators.op` for boolean operators).

        the dictionary were not supported.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 4926

        Implemented full support for "truediv" and "floordiv" using the
        "/" and "//" operators.  A "truediv" operation between two expressions
        using :class:`_types.Integer` now considers the result to be
        :class:`_types.Numeric`, and the dialect-level compilation will cast
        the right operand to a numeric type on a dialect-specific basis to ensure
        truediv is achieved.  For floordiv, conversion is also added for those
        databases that don't already do floordiv by default (MySQL, Oracle) and
        the ``FLOOR()`` function is rendered in this case, as well as for
        cases where the right operand is not an integer (needed for PostgreSQL,
        others).

        The change resolves issues both with inconsistent behavior of the
        division operator on different backends and also fixes an issue where
        integer division on Oracle would fail to be able to fetch a result due
        to inappropriate outputtypehandlers.

        reflected options.
        The options are stored in the table dialect options dictionary, so

        The behavior of :func:`_orm.defer` regarding primary key and "polymorphic
        discriminator" columns is revised such that these columns are no longer
        deferrable, either explicitly or when using a wildcard such as
        ``defer('*')``. Previously, a wildcard deferral would not load
        PK/polymorphic columns which led to errors in all cases, as the ORM relies
        upon these columns to produce object identities. The behavior of explicit
        deferral of primary key columns is unchanged as these deferrals already
        were implicitly ignored.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, sql

        Added an additional lookup step to the compiler which will track all FROM
        clauses which are tables, that may have the same name shared in multiple
        schemas where one of the schemas is the implicit "default" schema; in this
        case, the table name when referring to that name without a schema
        qualification will be rendered with an anonymous alias name at the compiler
        level in order to disambiguate the two (or more) names. The approach of
        schema-qualifying the normally unqualified name with the server-detected
        "default schema name" value was also considered, however this approach
        doesn't apply to Oracle nor is it accepted by SQL Server, nor would it work
        with multiple entries in the PostgreSQL search path. The name collision
        issue resolved here has been identified as affecting at least Oracle,
        PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL and MariaDB.

        The :meth:`_sqltypes.TypeEngine.with_variant` method now returns a copy of
        the original :class:`_sqltypes.TypeEngine` object, rather than wrapping it
        inside the ``Variant`` class, which is effectively removed (the import
        symbol remains for backwards compatibility with code that may be testing
        for this symbol). While the previous approach maintained in-Python
        behaviors, maintaining the original type allows for clearer type checking
        and debugging.

        :meth:`_sqltypes.TypeEngine.with_variant` also accepts multiple dialect
        names per call as well, in particular this is helpful for related

        scalar objects rather than :class:`.Row` objects, as though the

        server side defaults established as part of table DDL and/or server-side

        * multi-row RETURNING is implemented, meaning multiple RETURNING rows are
          now received for DML statements that produce more than one row for
          RETURNING.
        * "executemany RETURNING" is also implemented - this allows RETURNING to
          yield row-per statement when ``cursor.executemany()`` is used.
          The implementation of this part of the feature delivers dramatic
          performance improvements to ORM inserts, in the same way as was

        Python string values for which a SQL type is determined from the type of
        the value, mainly when using :func:`_sql.literal`, will now apply the
        :class:`_types.String` type, rather than the :class:`_types.Unicode`
        datatype, for Python string values that test as "ascii only" using Python
        ``str.isascii()``. If the string is not ``isascii()``, the
        :class:`_types.Unicode` datatype will be bound instead, which was used in
        all string detection previously. This behavior **only applies to in-place
        detection of datatypes when using ``literal()`` or other contexts that have
        no existing datatype**, which is not usually the case under normal
        :class:`_schema.Column` comparison operations, where the type of the
        :class:`_schema.Column` being compared always takes precedence.

        Use of the :class:`_types.Unicode` datatype can determine literal string
        formatting on backends such as SQL Server, where a literal value (i.e.
        using ``literal_binds``) will be rendered as ``N'<value>'`` instead of
        ``'value'``. For normal bound value handling, the :class:`_types.Unicode`
        datatype also may have implications for passing values to the DBAPI, again
        in the case of SQL Server, the pyodbc driver supports the use of
        :ref:`setinputsizes mode <mssql_pyodbc_setinputsizes>` which will handle
        :class:`_types.String` versus :class:`_types.Unicode` differently.
