    Fixed issue where joined eager loading would fail to use the "nested" form
    of the query when GROUP BY or DISTINCT were present if the eager joins
    being added were many-to-ones, leading to additional columns in the columns
    clause which would then cause errors.  The check for "nested" is tuned to
    be enabled for these queries even for many-to-one joined eager loaders, and
    the "only do nested if it's one to many" aspect is now localized to when
    the query only has LIMIT or OFFSET added.
