    Improved the ability for :class:`.TypeDecorator` to produce a correct
    ``repr()`` for "schema" types such as :class:`.Enum` and :class:`.Boolean`.
    This is mostly to support the Alembic autogenerate use case so that custom
    types render with relevant arguments present.  Improved the architecture
    used by :class:`.TypeEngine` to produce ``repr()`` strings to be more
    modular for compound types like :class:`.TypeDecorator`.
