    A significant change to the ORM mechanics involved with both
    :func:`.orm.with_loader_criteria` as well as single table inheritance, to
    more aggressively locate WHERE criteria which should be augmented by either
    the custom criteria or single-table inheritance criteria; SELECT statements
    that do not include the entity within the columns clause or as an explicit
    FROM, but still reference the entity within the WHERE clause, are now
    covered, in particular this will allow subqueries using ``EXISTS (SELECT
    1)`` such as those rendered by :meth:`.RelationshipProperty.Comparator.any`
    and :meth:`.RelationshipProperty.Comparator.has`.
