    Session autoflush behavior has been simplified to unconditionally flush the
    session each time an execution takes place, regardless of whether an ORM
    statement or Core statement is being executed. This change eliminates the
    previous conditional logic that only flushed when ORM-related statements
    were detected, which had become difficult to define clearly with the unified
    v2 syntax that allows both Core and ORM execution patterns. The change
    provides more consistent and predictable session behavior across all types
    of SQL execution.
