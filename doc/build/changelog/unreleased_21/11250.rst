    Fix mssql+pyodbc issue where valid plus signs in an already-unquoted
    ``odbc_connect=`` (raw DBAPI) connection string are replaced with spaces.

    The pyodbc connector would unconditionally pass the odbc_connect value
    to unquote_plus(), even if it was not required. So, if the (unquoted)
    odbc_connect value contained ``PWD=pass+word`` that would get changed to
    ``PWD=pass word``, and the login would fail. One workaround was to quote
    just the plus sign — ``PWD=pass%2Bword`` — which would then get unquoted
    to ``PWD=pass+word``.
