    The "non primary" mapper feature, long deprecated in SQLAlchemy since
    version 1.3, has been removed.   The sole use case for "non primary"
    mappers was that of using :func:`_orm.relationship` to link to a mapped
    class against an alternative selectable; this use case is now suited by the
    :ref:`relationship_aliased_class` feature.
