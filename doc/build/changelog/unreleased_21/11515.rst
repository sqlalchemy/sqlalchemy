    Enhanced the caching structure of the :paramref:`_expression.over.rows`
    and :paramref:`_expression.over.range` so that different numerical
    values for the rows /
    range fields are cached on the same cache key, to the extent that the
    underlying SQL does not actually change (i.e. "unbounded", "current row",
    negative/positive status will still change the cache key).  This prevents
    the use of many different numerical range/rows value for a query that is
    otherwise identical from filling up the SQL cache.

    Note that the semi-private compiler method ``_format_frame_clause()``
    is removed by this fix, replaced with a new method
    ``visit_frame_clause()``.  Third party dialects which may have referred
    to this method will need to change the name and revise the approach to
    rendering the correct SQL for that dialect.
