        Refactored identity insert handling to improve readability and maintainability:
        - Extracted identity insert logic into helper methods:
            * : Determines if identity insert should be enabled.
            * : Handles warnings or errors based on ``warn_on_identity_insert``.
        - Simplified the main method by delegating responsibilities to these helper methods.
        - Added validation for ``warn_on_identity_insert``:
            * Ensures the value is one of ``"warn"``, ``"error"``, or ``"silence"``.
            * Raises ``ValueError`` for invalid values.
        - Improved type safety and clarity for identity insert behavior.
        - Added warnings and error messages to guide users when ``warn_on_identity_insert`` is set to ``"warn"`` or ``"error"``.
        This refactor enhances code organization, reduces redundancy, and ensures consistent behavior for identity insert handling.
