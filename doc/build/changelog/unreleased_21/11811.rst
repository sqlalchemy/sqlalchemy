    The :class:`.Float` and :class:`.Numeric` types are no longer automatically
    considered as auto-incrementing columns when the
    :paramref:`_schema.Column.autoincrement` parameter is left at its default
    of ``"auto"`` on a :class:`_schema.Column` that is part of the primary key.
    When the parameter is set to ``True``, a :class:`.Numeric` type will be
    accepted as an auto-incrementing datatype for primary key columns, but only
    if its scale is explicitly given as zero; otherwise, an error is raised.
    This is a change from 2.0 where all numeric types including floats were
    automatically considered as "autoincrement" for primary key columns.
