    Added support for the matrix multiplication operator (``@``), corresponding
    to the Python function :func:`operator.matmul`. In the context of SQL
    expressions, using the ``@`` operator between two column expressions will
    render the ``@`` operator in the resulting SQL string. This allows
    representing matrix multiplication operations directly within SQLAlchemy
    expressions.
