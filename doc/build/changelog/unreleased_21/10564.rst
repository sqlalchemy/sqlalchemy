    The :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary` parameter no longer uses Python
    ``eval()`` to evaluate the given string.   This parameter when passed a
    string should resolve to a table name that's present in the local
    :class:`.MetaData` collection only, and never needs to be any kind of
    Python expression otherwise.  To use a real deferred callable based on a
    name that may not be locally present yet, use a lambda instead.
