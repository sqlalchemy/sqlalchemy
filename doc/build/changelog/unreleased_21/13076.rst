    :tickets: 13076

    Fixes to the MySQL/MariaDB dialect so that mariadb-specific features such
    as the :class:`.mariadb.INET4` and :class:`.mariadb.INET6` datatype may be
    used with an :class:`.Engine` that uses a ``mysql://`` URL, if the backend
    database is actually a mariadb database.   Previously, support for MariaDB
    features when ``mysql://`` URLs were used instead of ``mariadb://`` URLs
    was ad-hoc; with this issue resolution, the full set of schema / compiler /
    type features are now available regardless of how the URL was presented.
