    Added support for native BOOLEAN support in Oracle Database 23c and above.
    The Oracle dialect now renders ``BOOLEAN`` automatically when
    :class:`.Boolean` is used in DDL, and also now supports direct use of the
    :class:`.BOOLEAN` datatype, when 23c and above is in use.  For Oracle
    versions prior to 23c, boolean values continue to be emulated using
    SMALLINT as before.   Special case handling is also present to ensure a
    SMALLINT that's interpreted with the :class:`.Boolean` datatype on Oracle
    Database 23c and above continues to return bool values. Pull request
