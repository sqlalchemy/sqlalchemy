    Added support for native BOOLEAN type in Oracle Database 23c and above.
    The Oracle dialect now automatically uses the native BOOLEAN type when
    connected to Oracle Database 23c or later, as determined by the server
    version. For Oracle versions prior to 23c, boolean values continue to be
    emulated using SMALLINT as before.
