    Modified the MariaDB dialect so that when using the :class:`_sqltypes.Uuid`
    datatype with  MariaDB >= 10.7, leaving the
    :paramref:`_sqltypes.Uuid.native_uuid` parameter at its default of True,
    the native ``UUID`` datatype will be rendered in DDL and used for database
    communication, rather than ``CHAR(32)`` (the non-native UUID type) as was
    the case previously.   This is a behavioral change since 2.0, where the
    generic :class:`_sqltypes.Uuid` datatype delivered ``CHAR(32)`` for all
    MySQL and MariaDB variants.   Support for all major DBAPIs is implemented
    including support for less common "insertmanyvalues" scenarios where UUID
    values are generated in different ways for primary keys.   Thanks much to
    Volodymyr Kochetkov for delivering the PR.
