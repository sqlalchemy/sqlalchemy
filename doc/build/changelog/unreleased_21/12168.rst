    A significant behavioral change has been made to the behavior of the
    :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.default` and
    :paramref:`_orm.relationship.default` parameters, when used with
    SQLAlchemy's :ref:`orm_declarative_native_dataclasses` feature introduced
    in 2.0, where the given value (assumed to be an immutable scalar value) is
    no longer passed to the ``@dataclass`` API as a real default, instead a
    token that leaves the value un-set in the object's ``__dict__`` is used, in
    conjunction with a descriptor-level default.  This prevents an un-set
    default value from overriding a default that was actually set elsewhere,
    such as in relationship / foreign key assignment patterns as well as in
    :meth:`_orm.Session.merge` scenarios.   See the full writeup in the
    :ref:`whatsnew_21_toplevel` document which includes guidance on how to
    re-enable the 2.0 version of the behavior if needed.
