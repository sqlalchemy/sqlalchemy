    A change in the mechanics of how Python dataclasses are applied to classes
    that use :class:`.MappedAsDataclass` or
    :meth:`.registry.mapped_as_dataclass` to apply ``__annotations__`` that are
    as identical as is possible to the original ``__annotations__`` given,
    while also adding attributes that SQLAlchemy considers to be part of
    dataclass ``__annotations__``, then restoring the previous annotations in
    exactly the same format as they were, using patterns that work with
    :pep:`649` as closely as possible.
