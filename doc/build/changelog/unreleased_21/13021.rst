    A change in the mechanics of how Python dataclasses are applied to classes
    that use :class:`.MappedAsDataclass` or
    :meth:`.registry.mapped_as_dataclass`, to no longer modify the
    `__annotations__` collection that's on the class, instead manipulating
    regular class-bound attributes in order to satisfy the class requirements
    for the dataclass creation function.  This works around an issue that has
    appeared in Python 3.14.1, provides for a much simpler implementation, and
    also maintains accurate typing information about the attributes as the
    dataclass is built.
