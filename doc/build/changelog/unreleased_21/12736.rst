    Added a new concept of "operator classes" to the SQL operators supported by
    SQLAlchemy, represented within the enum :class:`.OperatorClass`.  The
    purpose of this structure is to provide an extra layer of validation when a
    particular kind of SQL operation is used with a particular datatype, to
    catch early the use of an operator that does not have any relevance to the
    datatype in use; a simple example is an integer or numeric column used with
    a "string match" operator.
