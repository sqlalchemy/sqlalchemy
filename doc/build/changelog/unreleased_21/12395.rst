    The behavior of :func:`_orm.with_polymorphic` when used with a single
    inheritance mapping has been changed such that its behavior should match as
    closely as possible to that of an equivalent joined inheritance mapping.
    Specifically this means that the base class specified in the
    :func:`_orm.with_polymorphic` construct will be the basemost class that is
    loaded, as well as all descendant classes of that basemost class.
    The change includes that the descendant classes named will no longer be
    exclusively indicated in "WHERE polymorphic_col IN" criteria; instead, the
    whole hierarchy starting with the given basemost class will be loaded.  If
    the query indicates that rows should only be instances of a specific
    subclass within the polymorphic hierarchy, an error is raised if an
    incompatible superclass is loaded in the result since it cannot be made to
    match the requested class; this behavior is the same as what joined
    inheritance has done for many years. The change also allows a single result
    set to include column-level results from multiple sibling classes at once
    which was not previously possible with single table inheritance.
