    Added support for the pow operator (``**``), with a default SQL
    implementation of the ``POW()`` function.   On Oracle Database, PostgreSQL
    and MSSQL it renders as ``POWER()``.   As part of this change, the operator
    routes through a new first class ``func`` member :class:`_functions.pow`,
    which renders on Oracle Database, PostgreSQL and MSSQL as ``POWER()``.
