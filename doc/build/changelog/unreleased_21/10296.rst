    Added an initialize step to the import of
    ``sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio`` so that ``greenlet`` will
    be imported only when the asyncio extension is first imported.
    Alternatively, the ``greenlet`` library is still imported lazily on
    first use to support use case that don't make direct use of the
    SQLAlchemy asyncio extension.
