    The :class:`.Double` type is now used when a Python float value is detected
    as a literal value to be sent as a bound parameter, rather than the
    :class:`.Float` type.  :class:`.Double` has the same implementation as
    :class:`.Float`, but when rendered in a CAST, produces ``DOUBLE`` or
    ``DOUBLE PRECISION`` rather than ``FLOAT``.   The former better matches
    Python's ``float`` datatype which uses 8-byte double-precision storage.
    Third party dialects which don't support the :class:`.Double` type directly
    may need adjustment so that they render an appropriate keyword (e.g.
    ``FLOAT``) when the :class:`.Double` datatype is encountered.
