    The :func:`_orm.aliased` object now emits warnings when an attribute is
    accessed on an aliased class that cannot be located in the target
    selectable, for those cases where the :func:`_orm.aliased` is against a
    different FROM clause than the regular mapped table (such as a subquery).
    This helps users identify cases where column names don't match between the
    aliased class and the underlying selectable. When
    :paramref:`_orm.aliased.adapt_on_names` is ``True``, the warning suggests
    checking the column name; when ``False``, it suggests using the
    ``adapt_on_names`` parameter for name-based matching.
