    The :class:`.Row` object now no longer makes use of an intermediary
    ``Tuple`` in order to represent its individual element types; instead,
    the individual element types are present directly, via new :pep:`646`
    integration, now available in more recent versions of Mypy.  Mypy
    1.7 or greater is now required for statements, results and rows
    to be correctly typed.   Pull request courtesy Yurii Karabas.
