    Added support for the SQL ``CREATE VIEW`` statement via the new
    :class:`.CreateView` DDL class. The new class allows creating database
    views from SELECT statements, with support for options such as
    ``TEMPORARY``, ``IF NOT EXISTS``, and ``MATERIALIZED`` where supported by
    the target database. Views defined with :class:`.CreateView` integrate with
    :class:`.MetaData` for automated DDL generation and provide a
    :class:`.Table` object for querying.
