    :tickets: 12570

    Added new parameter :paramref:`_orm.composite.return_none_on` to
    :func:`_orm.composite`, which allows control over if and when this
    composite attribute should resolve to ``None`` when queried or retrieved
    from the object directly.  By default, a composite object is always present
    on the attribute, including for a pending object which is a behavioral
    change since 2.0.   When :paramref:`_orm.composite.return_none_on` is
    specified, a callable is passed that returns True or False to indicate if
    the given arguments indicate the composite should be returned as None. This
    parameter may also be set automatically when ORM Annotated Declarative is
    used; if the annotation is given as ``Mapped[SomeClass|None]``, a
    :paramref:`_orm.composite.return_none_on` rule is applied that will return
    ``None`` if all contained columns are themselves ``None``.
