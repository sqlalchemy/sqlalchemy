    the :class:`.Numeric` and :class:`.Float` SQL types have been separated out
    so that :class:`.Float` no longer inherits from :class:`.Numeric`; instead,
    they both extend from a common mixin :class:`.NumericCommon`.  This
    corrects for some architectural shortcomings where numeric and float types
    are typically separate, and establishes more consistency with
    :class:`.Integer` also being a distinct type.   The change should not have
    any end-user implications except for code that may be using
    ``isinstance()`` to test for the :class:`.Numeric` datatype; third party
    dialects which rely upon specific implementation types for numeric and/or
    float may also require adjustment to maintain compatibility.
