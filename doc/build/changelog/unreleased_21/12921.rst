    The :meth:`_events.SessionEvents.do_orm_execute` event now allows direct
    mutation or replacement of the :attr:`.ORMExecuteState.parameters`
    dictionary or list, which will take effect when the the statement is
    executed.  Previously, changes to this collection were not accommodated by
    the event hook.  Pull request courtesy Shamil.
