    Named types such as :class:`_postgresql.ENUM` and
    :class:`_postgresql.DOMAIN` (as well as the dialect-agnostic
    :class:`_types.Enum` version) are now more strongly associated with the
    :class:`_schema.MetaData` at the top of the table hierarchy and are
    de-associated with any particular :class:`_schema.Table` they may be a part
    of. This better represents how PostgreSQL named types exist independently
    of any particular table, and that they may be used across many tables
    simultaneously.  The change impacts the behavior of the "default schema"
    for a named type, as well as the CREATE/DROP behavior in relationship to
    the :class:`.MetaData` and :class:`.Table` construct.  The change also
    includes a new :class:`.CheckFirst` enumeration which allows fine grained
    control over "check" queries during DDL operations, as well as that the
    :paramref:`_types.SchemaType.inherit_schema` parameter is deprecated and
    will emit a deprecation warning when used.  See the migration notes for
    full details.
