    Fixed an issue in :meth:`_sql.Select.join_from` where the join condition
    between the left and right tables specified in the method call could be
    incorrectly determined based on an intermediate table already present in
    the FROM clause, rather than matching the foreign keys between the
    immediate left and right arguments. The join condition is now determined by
    matching primary keys between the two tables explicitly passed to
    :meth:`_sql.Select.join_from`, ensuring consistent and predictable join
    behavior regardless of the order of join operations or other tables present
    in the query.  The fix is applied to both the Core and ORM implementations
    of :meth:`_sql.Select.join_from`.
