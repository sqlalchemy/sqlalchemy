    A :class:`.CompileError` is raised if attempting to create a PostgreSQL
    :class:`_postgresql.ENUM` or :class:`_postgresql.DOMAIN` datatype using a
    name that matches a known pg_catalog datatype name, and a default schema is
    not specified.   These types must be explicit within a schema in order to
    be differentiated from the built-in pg_catalog type.  The "public" or
    otherwise default schema is not chosen by default here since the type can
    only be reflected back using the explicit schema name as well (it is
    otherwise not visible due to the pg_catalog name).  Pull request courtesy
