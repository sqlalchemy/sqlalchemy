    Added support for using :func:`_orm.with_expression` to populate a
    :func:`_orm.query_expression` attribute that is also configured as the
    ``polymorphic_on`` discriminator column. The ORM now detects when a query
    expression column is serving as the polymorphic discriminator and updates
    it to use the column provided via :func:`_orm.with_expression`, enabling
    polymorphic loading to work correctly in this scenario. This allows for
    patterns such as where the discriminator value is computed from a related
    table.
