    The default DBAPI driver for the Oracle Database dialect has been changed
    to ``oracledb`` instead of ``cx_oracle``. The ``cx_oracle`` driver remains
    fully supported and can be explicitly specified in the connection URL
    using ``oracle+cx_oracle://``.

    The ``oracledb`` driver is a modernized version of ``cx_oracle`` with
    better performance characteristics and ongoing active development from
    Oracle.

    The default DBAPI driver for the PostgreSQL dialect has been changed to
    ``psycopg`` (psycopg version 3) instead of ``psycopg2``. The ``psycopg2``
    driver remains fully supported and can be explicitly specified in the
    connection URL using ``postgresql+psycopg2://``.

    The ``psycopg`` (version 3) driver includes improvements over ``psycopg2``
    including better performance when using C extensions and native support
    for async operations.
