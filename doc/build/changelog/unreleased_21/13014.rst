    :tickets: 13014

    Added support for monotonic server-side functions such as PostgreSQL 18's
    ``uuidv7()`` to work with the :ref:`engine_insertmanyvalues` feature.
    By passing ``monotonic=True`` to any :class:`.Function`, the function can
    be used as a sentinel for tracking row order in batched INSERT operations
    with RETURNING, allowing the ORM and Core to efficiently batch INSERT
    statements while maintaining deterministic row ordering.
