    Support for ``VIRTUAL`` computed columns on PostgreSQL 18 and later has
    been added. The default behavior when :paramref:`.Computed.persisted` is
    not specified has been changed to align with PostgreSQL 18's default of
    ``VIRTUAL``. When :paramref:`.Computed.persisted` is not specified, no
    keyword is rendered on PostgreSQL 18 and later; on older versions a
    warning is emitted and ``STORED`` is used as the default. To explicitly
    request ``STORED`` behavior on all PostgreSQL versions, specify
    ``persisted=True``.
