    :tickets: 8601

    The :meth:`_sql.Select.filter_by`, :meth:`_sql.Update.filter_by` and
    :meth:`_sql.Delete.filter_by` methods now search across all entities
    present in the statement, rather than limiting their search to only the
    last joined entity or the first FROM entity. This allows these methods
    to locate attributes unambiguously across multiple joined tables,
    resolving issues where changing the order of operations such as
    :meth:`_sql.Select.with_only_columns` would cause the method to fail.

    If an attribute name exists in more than one FROM clause entity, an
    :class:`_exc.AmbiguousColumnError` is now raised, indicating that
    :meth:`_sql.Select.filter` (or :meth:`_sql.Select.where`) should be used
    instead with explicit table-qualified column references.
