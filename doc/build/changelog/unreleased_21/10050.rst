.. change::
    :tags: feature, orm
    :tickets: 10050

    The :paramref:`_orm.relationship.back_populates` argument to
    :func:`_orm.relationship` may now be passed as a Python callable, which
    resolves to either the direct linked ORM attribute, or a string value as
    before.  ORM attributes are also accepted directly by
    :paramref:`_orm.relationship.back_populates`.   This change allows type
    checkers and IDEs to confirm the argument for
    :paramref:`_orm.relationship.back_populates` is valid. Thanks to Priyanshu
    Parikh for the help on suggesting and helping to implement this feature.
