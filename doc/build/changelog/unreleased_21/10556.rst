Adds the :class:`dialects.postgresql.BitString` representing PostgreSQL bitstrings
in python. This type, which is a subtype of the :class:`str` builtin includes
functionality for converting to/from :class:`int` and :class:`bytes`, in
addition to implementing utility methods and operators for dealing with bits.

In PostgreSQL drivers, the :class:`postgresql.BIT` type now binds to instances of
this new utility class.
