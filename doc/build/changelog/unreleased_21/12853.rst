    Added new generalized aggregate function ordering to functions via the
    :func:`_functions.FunctionElement.aggregate_order_by` method, which
    receives an expression and generates the appropriate embedded "ORDER BY" or
    "WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY)" phrase depending on backend database.  This new
    function supersedes the use of the PostgreSQL
    :func:`_postgresql.aggregate_order_by` function, which remains present for
    backward compatibility.   To complement the new parameter, the
    :paramref:`_functions.aggregate_strings.order_by` which adds ORDER BY
    capability to the :class:`_functions.aggregate_strings` dialect-agnostic
    function which works for all included backends. Thanks much to Reuven
    Starodubski with help on this patch.
