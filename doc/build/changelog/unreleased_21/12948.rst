    Added support for PostgreSQL 14+ HSTORE subscripting syntax. When connected
    to PostgreSQL 14 or later, HSTORE columns now automatically use the native
    subscript notation ``hstore_col['key']`` instead of the arrow operator
    ``hstore_col -> 'key'`` for both read and write operations. This provides
    better compatibility with PostgreSQL's native HSTORE subscripting feature
    while maintaining backward compatibility with older PostgreSQL versions.

    .. warning:: Indexes in existing PostgreSQL databases which were indexed
       on an HSTORE subscript expression would need to be updated in order to
       match the new SQL syntax.
