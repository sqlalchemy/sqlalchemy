    :tickets: 12548

    Added support for Python 3.14+ template strings (t-strings) via the new
    :func:`_sql.tstring` construct. This feature makes use of Python 3.14
    template strings as defined in :pep:`750`, allowing for ergonomic SQL
    statement construction by automatically interpolating Python values and
    SQLAlchemy expressions within template strings.
