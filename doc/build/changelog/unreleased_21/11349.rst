    Revised the set "binary" operators for the association proxy ``set()``
    interface to correctly raise ``TypeError`` for invalid use of the ``|``,
    ``&``, ``^``, and ``-`` operators, as well as the in-place mutation
    versions of these methods, to match the behavior of standard Python
    ``set()`` as well as SQLAlchemy ORM's "intstrumented" set implementation.
