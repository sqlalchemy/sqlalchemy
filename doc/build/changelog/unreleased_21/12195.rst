    Added the ability to create custom SQL constructs that can define new
    clauses within SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements without
    needing to modify the construction or compilation code of of
    :class:`.Select`, :class:`_sql.Insert`, :class:`.Update`, or :class:`.Delete`
    directly.  Support for testing these constructs, including caching support,
    is present along with an example test suite.  The use case for these
    constructs is expected to be third party dialects for analytical SQL
    (so-called NewSQL) or other novel styles of database that introduce new
    clauses to these statements.   A new example suite is included which
    illustrates the ``QUALIFY`` SQL construct used by several NewSQL databases
    which includes a cachable implementation as well as a test suite.
