    A sweep through class and function names in the ORM renames many classes
    and functions that have no intent of public visibility to be underscored.
    This is to reduce ambiguity as to which APIs are intended to be targeted by
    third party applications and extensions.  Third parties are encouraged to
    propose new public APIs in Discussions to the extent they are needed to
    replace those that have been clarified as private.
