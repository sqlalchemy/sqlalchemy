    Added :class:`_orm.RegistryEvents` event class that allows event listeners
    to be established on a :class:`_orm.registry` object. The new class
    provides three events: :meth:`_orm.RegistryEvents.resolve_type_annotation`
    which allows customization of type annotation resolution that can
    supplement or replace the use of the
    :paramref:`.registry.type_annotation_map` dictionary, including that it can
    be helpful with custom resolution for complex types such as those of
    :pep:`695`, as well as :meth:`_orm.RegistryEvents.before_configured` and
    :meth:`_orm.RegistryEvents.after_configured`, which are registry-local
    forms of the mapper-wide version of these hooks.
