    Ignore :paramref:`_orm.Session.join_transaction_mode` in all cases when
    the bind provided to the :class:`_orm.Session` is an
    :class:`_engine.Engine`.
    Previously if an event that executed before the session logic,
    like :meth:`_engine.ConnectionEvents.engine_connect`,
    left the connection with an active transaction, the
    :paramref:`_orm.Session.join_transaction_mode` behavior took
    place, leading to a surprising behavior.
