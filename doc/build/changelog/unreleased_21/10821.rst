    The :meth:`_types.ARRAY.Comparator.any` and
    :meth:`_types.ARRAY.Comparator.all` methods for the :class:`_types.ARRAY`
    type are now deprecated for removal; these two methods along with
    :func:`_postgresql.Any` and :func:`_postgresql.All` have been legacy for
    some time as they are superseded by the :func:`_sql.any_` and
    :func:`_sql.all_` functions, which feature more intutive use.
