    Fixed issue in name normalization (e.g. "uppercase" backends like Oracle)
    where using a :class:`.TextualSelect` would not properly maintain as
    uppercase column names that were quoted as uppercase, even though
    the :class:`.TextualSelect` includes a :class:`.Column` that explicitly
    holds this uppercase name.
