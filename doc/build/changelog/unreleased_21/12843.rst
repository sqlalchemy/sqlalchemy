    ORM entities can now be involved within the SQL expressions used within
    :paramref:`_orm.relationship.primaryjoin` and
    :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondaryjoin` parameters without the ORM
    entity information being implicitly sanitized, allowing ORM-specific
    features such as single-inheritance criteria in subqueries to continue
    working even when used in this context.   This is made possible by overall
    ORM simplifications that occurred as of the 2.0 series.  The changes here
    also provide a performance boost (up to 20%) for certain query compilation
    scenarios.
