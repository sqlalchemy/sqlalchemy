    Fixed issue in the :meth:`.ConnectionEvents.after_cursor_execute` method
    where the SQL statement and parameter list for an "insertmanyvalues"
    operation sent to the event would not be the actual SQL / parameters just
    emitted on the cursor, instead being the non-batched form of the statement
    that's used as a template to generate the batched statements.
