    Fixed issue in new :pep:`646` support for result sets where an issue in the
    mypy type checker prevented "scalar" methods including
    :meth:`.Connection.scalar`, :meth:`.Result.scalar`,
    :meth:`_orm.Session.scalar`, as well as async versions of these methods
    from applying the correct type to the scalar result value, when the columns
    in the originating :func:`_sql.select` were typed as ``Any``.  Pull request
    courtesy Yurii Karabas.
