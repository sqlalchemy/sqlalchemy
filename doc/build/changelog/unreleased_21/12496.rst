.. change::
    :tags: feature, sql
    :tickets: 12496

    Added new Core feature :func:`_sql.from_dml_column` that may be used in
    expressions inside of :meth:`.UpdateBase.values` for INSERT or UPDATE; this
    construct will copy whatever SQL expression is used for the given target
    column in the statement to be used with additional columns. The construct
    is mostly intended to be a helper with ORM :class:`.hybrid_property` within
    DML hooks.

.. change::
    :tags: feature, orm
    :tickets: 12496

    Added new hybrid method :meth:`.hybrid_property.bulk_dml` which
    works in a similar way as :meth:`.hybrid_property.update_expression` for
    bulk ORM operations.  A user-defined class method can now populate a bulk
    insert mapping dictionary using the desired hybrid mechanics.   New
    documentation is added showing how both of these methods can be used
    including in combination with the new :func:`_sql.from_dml_column`
    construct.
