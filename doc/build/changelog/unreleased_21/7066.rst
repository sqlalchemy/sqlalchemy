    Added new implementation for the :meth:`.Select.params` method and that of
    similar statements, via a new statement-only
    :meth:`.ExecutableStatement.params` method which works more efficiently and
    correctly than the previous implementations available from
    :class:`.ClauseElement`, by assocating the given parameter dictionary with
    the statement overall rather than cloning the statement and rewriting its
    bound parameters.  The :meth:`_sql.ClauseElement.params` and
    :meth:`_sql.ClauseElement.unique_params` methods, when called on an object
    that does not implement :class:`.ExecutableStatement`, will continue to
    work the old way of cloning the object, and will emit a deprecation
    warning.    This issue both resolves the architectural / performance
    concerns of :ticket:`7066` and also provides correct ORM compatibility for
    functions like :func:`_orm.aliased`, reported by :ticket:`12915`.
