    Changed the query style for ORM queries emitted by :meth:`.Session.get` as
    well as many-to-one lazy load queries to use the default labeling style,
    :attr:`_sql.SelectLabelStyle.LABEL_STYLE_DISAMBIGUATE_ONLY`, which normally
    does not apply labels to columns in a SELECT statement. Previously, the
    older style :attr:`_sql.SelectLabelStyle.LABEL_STYLE_TABLENAME_PLUS_COL`
    that labels columns as `<tablename>_<columname>` was used for
    :meth:`.Session.get` to maintain compatibility with :class:`_orm.Query`.
    The change allows the string representation of ORM queries to be less
    verbose in all cases outside of legacy :class:`_orm.Query` use. Pull
    request courtesy Inada Naoki.
