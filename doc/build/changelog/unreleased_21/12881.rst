    Free-threaded Python versions are now supported in wheels released on Pypi.
    This integrates with overall free-threaded support added as part of
    :ticket:`12881` for the 2.0 and 2.1 series, which includes new test suites
    as well as a few improvements to race conditions observed under
    freethreading.
