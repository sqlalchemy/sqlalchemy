    :tags: reflection, usecase
    :tickets: 2056

    Added new reflection method :meth:`.Inspector.get_sequence_names` which
    returns all the sequences defined and :meth:`.Inspector.has_sequence` to
    check if a particular sequence exits.
    Support for this method has been added to the backend that support
    :class:`.Sequence`: PostgreSQL, Oracle and MariaDB >= 10.3.
