    :versions: 2.0

    The deprecated mypy plugin is no longer fully functional with the latest
    series of mypy 1.11.0, as changes in the mypy interpreter are no longer
    compatible with the approach used by the plugin.  If code is dependent on
    the mypy plugin with sqlalchemy2-stubs, it's recommended to pin mypy to be
    below the 1.11.0 series.    Seek upgrading to the 2.0 series of SQLAlchemy
    and migrating to the modern type annotations.
