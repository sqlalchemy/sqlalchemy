    Additional logic has been added such that certain SQL expressions which
    typically wrap a single database column will use the name of that column as
    their "anonymous label" name within a SELECT statement, potentially making
    key-based lookups in result tuples more intutive.   The primary example of
    this is that of a CAST expression, e.g. ``CAST(table.colname AS INTEGER)``,
    which will export its default name as "colname", rather than the usual
    "anon_1" label, that is, ``CAST(table.colname AS INTEGER) AS colname``.
    If the inner expression doesn't have a name, then the previous "anonymous
    label" logic is used.  When using SELECT statements that make use of
    :meth:`_expression.Select.apply_labels`, such as those emitted by the ORM, the
    labeling logic will produce ``<tablename>_<inner column name>`` in the same
    was as if the column were named alone.   The logic applies right now to the
    :func:`.cast` and :func:`.type_coerce` constructs as well as some
    single-element boolean expressions.
