    Fixed bug where ORM :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` would not apply
    itself to a :meth:`_sql.Select.join` where the ON clause were given as a
    plain SQL comparison, rather than as a relationship target or similar.

    This is a backport of the same issue fixed in version 2.0 for 2.0.22.
