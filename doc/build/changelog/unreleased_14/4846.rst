    "Implicit autocommit", which is the COMMIT that occurs when a DML or DDL
    statement is emitted on a connection, is deprecated and won't be part of
    SQLAlchemy 2.0.   A 2.0-style warning is emitted when autocommit takes
    effect, so that the calling code may be adjusted to use an explicit
    transaction.

    As part of this change, DDL methods such as
    :meth:`_schema.MetaData.create_all` when used against an
    :class:`_engine.Engine` will run the operation in a BEGIN block if one is
    not started already.
