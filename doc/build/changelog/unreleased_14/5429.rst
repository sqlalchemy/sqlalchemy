	In SqlAlchemy 1.4, several operators are renamed to achieve more
	consistent naming across SqlAlchemy.

	The first operator changes are:
		
	* `isnot` is now `is_not`
	* `not_in_` is now `not_in`

	Because these are core operators, the internal migration strategy for this
	change is to support legacy terms for an extended period of time -- if not
	indefinitely -- but update all documentation, tutorials, and internal usage
	to the new terms.  The new terms are used to define the functions, and
	the legacy terms have been deprecated into aliases of the new terms.
