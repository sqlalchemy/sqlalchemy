    Fixed a series of issues regarding the position and sometimes the identity
    of rendered bound parameters, such as those used for SQLite, asyncpg,
    MySQL, Oracle and others. Some compiled forms would not maintain the order
    of parameters correctly, such as the PostgreSQL ``regexp_replace()``
    function, the "nesting" feature of the :class:`.CTE` construct first
    introduced in :ticket:`4123`, and selectable tables formed by using the
    :meth:`.FunctionElement.column_valued` method with Oracle.
