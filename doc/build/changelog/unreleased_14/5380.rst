    :tickets: 5380

    Along with the new transparent statement caching feature introduced as part
    of :ticket:`4369`, a new feature intended to decrease the Python overhead
    of creating statements is added, allowing lambdas to be used when
    indicating arguments being passed to a statement object such as select(),
    Query(), update(), etc., as well as allowing the construction of full
    statements within lambdas in a similar manner as that of the "baked query"
    system.   The rationale of using lambdas is adapted from that of the "baked
    query" approach which uses lambdas to encapsulate any amount of Python code
    into a callable that only needs to be called when the statement is first
    constructed into a string.  The new feature however is more sophisticated
    in that Python literal values that would be passed as parameters are
    automatically extracted, so that there is no longer a need to use
    bindparam() objects with such queries.   Use of the feature is optional and
    can be used to as small or as great a degree as is desired, while still
    allowing statements to be fully cacheable.
