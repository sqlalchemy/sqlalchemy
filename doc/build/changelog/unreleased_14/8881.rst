    Fixed issues in :func:`_orm.with_expression` where expressions that were
    composed of columns within a subquery being SELECTed from, or when using
    ``.from_statement()``, would not render correct SQL **if** the expression
    had a label name that matched the attribute which used
    :func:`_orm.query_expression`, even when :func:`_orm.query_expression` had
    no default expression. For the moment, if the :func:`_orm.query_expression`
    **does** have a default expression, that label name is still used for that
    default, and an additional label with the same name will be ignored.
    Overall, this case is pretty thorny so further adjustments might be
    warranted.
