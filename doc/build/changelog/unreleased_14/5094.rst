    Removed all dialect code related to support for Jython and zxJDBC. Jython
    has not been supported by SQLAlchemy for many years and it is not expected
    that the current zxJDBC code is at all functional; for the moment it just
    takes up space and adds confusion by showing up in documentation. At the
    moment, it appears that Jython has achieved Python 2.7 support in its
    releases but not Python 3.   If Jython were to be supported again, the form
    it should take is against the Python 3 version of Jython, and the various
    zxJDBC stubs for various backends should be implemented as a third party
    dialect.
