    Fixed bug where :meth:`_orm.Session.merge` would fail to preserve the
    current loaded contents of relationship attributes that were indicated with
    the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.viewonly` parameter, thus defeating
    strategies that use :meth:`_orm.Session.merge` to pull fully loaded objects
    from caches and other similar techniques. In a related change, fixed issue
    where an object that contains a loaded relationship that was nonetheless
    configured as ``lazy='raise'`` on the mapping would fail when passed to
    :meth:`_orm.Session.merge`; checks for "raise" are now suspended within
    the merge process assuming the :paramref:`_orm.Session.merge.load`
    parameter remains at its default of ``True``.

    Overall, this is a behavioral adjustment to a change introduced in the 1.4
    series as of :ticket:`4994`, which took "merge" out of the set of cascades
    applied by default to "viewonly" relationships. As "viewonly" relationships
    aren't persisted under any circumstances, allowing their contents to
    transfer during "merge" does not impact the persistence behavior of the
    target object. This allows :meth:`_orm.Session.merge` to correctly suit one
    of its use cases, that of adding objects to a :class:`.Session` that were
    loaded elsewhere, often for the purposes of restoring from a cache.
