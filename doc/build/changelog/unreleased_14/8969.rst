    Fixed regression caused by new support for reflection of partial indexes on
    SQLite added in 1.4.45 for :ticket:`8804`, where the ``index_list`` pragma
    command in very old versions of SQLite (possibly prior to 3.8.9) does not
    return the current expected number of columns, leading to exceptions raised
    when reflecting tables and indexes.
