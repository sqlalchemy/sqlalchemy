    Fixed issue where SQLite table reflection would fail for tables using
    ``WITHOUT ROWID`` and/or ``STRICT`` table options when the table contained
    generated columns. The regular expression used to parse ``CREATE TABLE``
    statements for generated column detection has been updated to properly
    handle these SQLite table options that appear after the column definitions.
