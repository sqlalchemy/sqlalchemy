    Added support for MySQL 8.0.1 + ``FOR SHARE`` to be emitted for the
    :meth:`.Select.with_for_update` method, which offers compatibility with
    ``NOWAIT`` and ``SKIP LOCKED``.  The new syntax is used only for MySQL when
    version 8.0.1 or higher is detected. Pull request courtesy JetDrag.
