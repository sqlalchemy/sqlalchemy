    Implemented initial support for free-threaded Python by adding new tests
    and reworking the test harness and GitHub Actions to include Python 3.13t
    and Python 3.14t in test runs. Two concurrency issues have been identified
    and fixed: the first involves initialization of the ``.c`` collection on a
    ``FromClause``, a continuation of :ticket:`12302`, where an optional mutex
    under free-threading is added; the second involves synchronization of the
    pool "first_connect" event, which first received thread synchronization in
    :ticket:`2964`, however under free-threading the creation of the mutex
    itself runs under the same free-threading mutex. Initial pull request and
    test suite courtesy Lysandros Nikolaou.
