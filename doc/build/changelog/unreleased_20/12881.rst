    Implemented initial support for free-threaded Python by adding new tests
    and reworking the test harness to include Python 3.13t and Python 3.14t in
    test runs. Two concurrency issues have been identified and fixed: the first
    involves initialization of the ``.c`` collection on a ``FromClause``, a
    continuation of :ticket:`12302`, where an optional mutex under
    free-threading is added; the second involves synchronization of the pool
    "first_connect" event, which first received thread synchronization in
    :ticket:`2964`, however under free-threading the creation of the mutex
    itself runs under the same free-threading mutex. Support for free-threaded
    wheels on Pypi is implemented as well within the 2.1 series only.  Initial
    pull request and test suite courtesy Lysandros Nikolaou.
