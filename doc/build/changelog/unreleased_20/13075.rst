    Fixed typing issues where ORM mapped classes and aliased entities could not
    be used as keys in result row mappings or as join targets in select
    statements. Patterns such as ``row._mapping[User]``,
    ``row._mapping[aliased(User)]``, ``row._mapping[with_polymorphic(...)]``
    (rejected by both mypy and Pylance), and ``.join(aliased(User))``
    (rejected by Pylance) are documented and fully supported at runtime but
    were previously rejected by type checkers. The type definitions for
    :class:`._KeyType` and :class:`._FromClauseArgument` have been updated to
    accept these ORM entity types.
