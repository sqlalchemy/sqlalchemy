    Fixed a critical issue in :class:`.Engine` where connections created in
    conjunction with the :meth:`.ConnectionEvents.do_connect` event listeners
    would receive shared, mutable collections for the connection arguments,
    leading to a variety of potential issues including unlimited growth of the
    argument list as well as elements within the parameter dictionary being
    shared among concurrent connection calls.  In particular this could impact
    do_connect routines making use of complex mutable authentication
    structures.
