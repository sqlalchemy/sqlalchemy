    Added new parameter :paramref:`.create_engine.skip_autocommit_rollback`
    which provides for a per-dialect feature of preventing the DBAPI
    ``.rollback()`` from being called under any circumstances, if the
    connection is detected as being in "autocommit" mode.   This improves upon
    a critical performance issue identified in MySQL dialects where the network
    overhead of the ``.rollback()`` call remains prohibitive even if autocommit
    mode is set.
