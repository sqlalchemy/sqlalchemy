    Improved the base implementation of the asyncio cursor such that it
    includes the option for the underlying driver's cursor to be actively
    closed in those cases where it requires ``await`` in order to complete the
    close sequence, rather than relying on garbage collection to "close" it,
    when a plain :class:`.Result` is returned that does not use ``await`` for
    any of its methods.  The previous approach of relying on gc was fine for
    MySQL and SQLite dialects but has caused problems with the aioodbc
    implementation on top of SQL Server.   The new option is enabled
    for those dialects which have an "awaitable" ``cursor.close()``, which
    includes the aioodbc, aiomysql, and asyncmy dialects (aiosqlite is also
    modified for 2.1 only).
