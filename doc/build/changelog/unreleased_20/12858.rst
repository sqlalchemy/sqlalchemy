    Fixed issue where calling :meth:`.Mapper.add_property` within mapper event
    hooks such as :meth:`.MapperEvents.instrument_class`,
    :meth:`.MapperEvents.after_mapper_constructed`, or
    :meth:`.MapperEvents.before_mapper_configured` would raise an
    ``AttributeError`` because the mapper's internal property collections were
    not yet initialized. The :meth:`.Mapper.add_property` method now handles
    early-stage property additions correctly, allowing properties including
    column properties, deferred columns, and relationships to be added during
    mapper initialization events.  Pull request courtesy G Allajmi.
