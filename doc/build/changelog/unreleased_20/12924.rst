    A series of improvements have been made for reflection of CHECK constraints
    on SQLite. The reflection logic now correctly handles table names
    containing the strings "CHECK" or "CONSTRAINT", properly supports all four
    SQLite identifier quoting styles (double quotes, single quotes, brackets,
    and backticks) for constraint names, and accurately parses CHECK constraint
    expressions containing parentheses within string literals using balanced
    parenthesis matching with string context tracking.    Big thanks to
    GruzdevAV for new test cases and implementation ideas.
