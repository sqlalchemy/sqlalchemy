    Improved association proxy to behave slightly better when the parent class
    is used in an :func:`_orm.aliased` construct, so that the proxy as
    delivered by the :class:`.Aliased` behaves appropriate in terms of that
    aliased construct, including operators like ``.any()`` and ``.has()`` work
    correctly.
