    Fixed critical issue where setting
    :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.isolation_level` to ``AUTOCOMMIT`` (as opposed
    to using the :meth:`_engine.Engine.execution_options` method) would fail to
    restore "autocommit" to a pooled connection if an alternate isolation level
    were temporarily selected using
    :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.isolation_level`.
