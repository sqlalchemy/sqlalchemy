    Reworked SQL Server column reflection to be based on the ``sys.columns``
    table rather than ``information_schema.columns`` view.  By correctly using
    the SQL Server ``object_id()`` function as a lead and joining to related
    tables on object_id rather than names, this repairs a variety of issues in
    SQL Server reflection, including:

    * Issue where reflected column comments would not correctly line up
      with the columns themselves in the case that the table had been ALTERed
    * Correctly targets tables with awkward names such as names with brackets,
      when reflecting not just the basic table / columns but also extended
      information including IDENTITY, computed columns, comments which
      did not work previously
    * Correctly targets IDENTITY, computed status from temporary tables
      which did not work previously
