    Fixed issue in the MSSQL dialect's foreign key reflection query where
    duplicate rows could be returned when a foreign key column and its
    referenced primary key column have the same name, and both the referencing
    and referenced tables have indexes with the same name. This resulted in an
    "ForeignKeyConstraint with duplicate source column references are not
    supported" error when attempting to reflect such tables. The query has been
    corrected to exclude indexes on the child table when looking for unique
    indexes referenced by foreign keys.
