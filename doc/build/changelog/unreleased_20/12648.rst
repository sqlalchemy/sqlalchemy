    Fixed yet another regression caused by by the DEFAULT rendering changes in
    2.0.40 :ticket:`12425`, similar to :ticket:`12488`, this time where using a
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP function with a fractional seconds portion inside a
    textual default value would also fail to be recognized as a
    non-parenthesized server default.
