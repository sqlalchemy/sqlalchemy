    Fixed issue where DDL compilation options were registered to the hard-coded
    dialect name ``mysql``. This made it awkward for MySQL-derived dialects
    like MariaDB, StarRocks, etc. to work with such options when different sets
    of options exist for different platforms. Options are now registered under
    the actual dialect name, and a fallback was added to help avoid errors when
    an option does not exist for that dialect.

    To maintain backwards compatibility, when using the MariaDB dialect with
    the options ``mysql_with_parser`` or ``mysql_using`` without also specifying
    the corresponding ``mariadb_`` prefixed options, a deprecation warning will
    be emitted. The ``mysql_`` prefixed options will continue to work during
    the deprecation period. Users should update their code to additionally
    specify ``mariadb_with_parser`` and ``mariadb_using`` when using the
    ``mariadb://`` dialect, or specify both options to support both dialects.
