    Fixed issue where the :func:`_sql.any_` and :func:`_sql.all_` aggregation
    operators would not correctly coerce the datatype of the compared value, in
    those cases where the compared value were not a simple int/str etc., such
    as a Python ``Enum`` or other custom value.   This would lead to execution
    time errors for these values.  This issue is essentially the same as
    :ticket:`6515` which was for the now-legacy :meth:`.ARRAY.any` and
    :meth:`.ARRAY.all` methods.
