    Fixed an issue in the PostgreSQL dialect where foreign key constraint
    reflection would incorrectly swap or fail to capture ``onupdate`` and
    ``ondelete`` values when these clauses appeared in a different order than
    expected in the constraint definition. This issue primarily affected
    PostgreSQL-compatible databases such as CockroachDB, which may return ``ON
    DELETE`` before ``ON UPDATE`` in the constraint definition string. The
    reflection logic now correctly parses both clauses regardless of their
    ordering.
