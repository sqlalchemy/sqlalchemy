    Fixed issue where SQLite dialect would fail to reflect constraint names
    that contained uppercase letters or other characters requiring quoting. The
    regular expressions used to parse primary key, foreign key, and unique
    constraint names from the ``CREATE TABLE`` statement have been updated to
    properly handle both quoted and unquoted constraint names.
