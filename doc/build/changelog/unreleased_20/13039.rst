    :tags: bug, sqlite
    :tickets: 13039

    Fixed issue in the aiosqlite driver where SQLAlchemy's setting of
    aiosqlite's worker thread to "daemon" stopped working because the aiosqlite
    architecture moved the location of the worker thread in version 0.22.0.
    This "daemon" flag is necessary so that a program is able to exit if the
    SQLite connection itself was not explicitly closed, which is particularly
    likely with SQLAlchemy as it maintains SQLite connections in a connection
    pool.  While it's perfectly fine to call :meth:`.AsyncEngine.dispose`
    before program exit, this is not historically or technically necessary for
    any driver of any known backend, since a primary feature of relational
    databases is durability.  The change also implements support for
    "terminate" with aiosqlite when using version version 0.22.1 or greater,
    which implements a sync ``.stop()`` method.
