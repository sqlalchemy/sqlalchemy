    Fixed issue where using the ``post_update`` feature would apply incorrect
    "pre-fetched" values to the ORM objects after a multi-row UPDATE process
    completed.  These "pre-fetched" values would come from any column that had
    an :paramref:`.Column.onupdate` callable or a version id generator used by
    :paramref:`.orm.Mapper.version_id_generator`; for a version id generator
    that delivered random identifiers like timestamps or UUIDs, this incorrect
    data would lead to a DELETE statement against those same rows to fail in
    the next step.
