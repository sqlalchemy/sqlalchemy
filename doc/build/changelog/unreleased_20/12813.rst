    Fixed typing bug where the :meth:`.Session.execute` method advertised that
    it would return a :class:`.CursorResult` if given an insert/update/delete
    statement.  This is not the general case as several flavors of ORM
    insert/update do not actually yield a :class:`.CursorResult` which cannot
    be differentiated at the typing overload level, so the method now yields
    :class:`.Result` in all cases.  For those cases where
    :class:`.CursorResult` is known to be returned and the ``.rowcount``
    attribute is required, please use ``typing.cast()``.
