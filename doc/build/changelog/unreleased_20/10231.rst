    :tags: orm, bug
    :tickets: 10231

    Fixed fairly major issue where execution options passed to
    :meth:`_orm.Session.execute`, as well as execution options local to the ORM
    executed statement itself, would not be propagated along to eager loaders
    such as that of :func:`_orm.selectinload`, :func:`_orm.immediateload`, and
    :meth:`_orm.subqueryload`, making it impossible to do things such as
    disabling the cache for a single statement or using
    ``schema_translate_map`` for a single statement, as well as the use of
    user-custom execution options.   A change has been made where **all**
    user-facing execution options present for :meth:`_orm.Session.execute` will
    be propagated along to additional loaders.

    As part of this change, the warning for "excessively deep" eager loaders
    leading to caching being disabled can be silenced on a per-statement
    basis by sending ``execution_options={"compiled_cache": None}`` to
    :meth:`_orm.Session.execute`, which will disable caching for the full
    series of statements within that scope.
