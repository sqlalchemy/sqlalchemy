    Fixed the structure of the SQL string used for the
    :ref:`engine_insertmanyvalues` feature when an explicit sequence with
    ``nextval()`` is used. The SQL function invocation for the sequence has
    been moved from being rendered inline within each tuple inside of VALUES to
    being rendered once in the SELECT that reads from VALUES. This change
    ensures the function is invoked in the correct order as rows are processed,
    rather than assuming PostgreSQL will execute inline function calls within
    VALUES in a particular order. While current PostgreSQL versions appear to
    handle the previous approach correctly, the database does not guarantee
    this behavior for future versions.
