    Fixed a caching issue where :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` would
    incorrectly reuse cached bound parameter values when used with
    :class:`_sql.CompoundSelect` constructs such as :func:`_sql.union`. The
    issue was caused by the cache key for compound selects not including the
    execution options that are part of the :class:`_sql.Executable` base class,
    which :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` uses to apply its criteria
    dynamically. The fix ensures that compound selects and other executable
    constructs properly include execution options in their cache key traversal.
