    Fixed issue in Python 3.14 where dataclass transformation would fail when
    a mapped class using :class:`.MappedAsDataclass` included a
    :func:`.relationship` referencing a class that was not available at
    runtime (e.g., within a ``TYPE_CHECKING`` block). This occurred when using
    Python 3.14's :pep:`649` deferred annotations feature, which is the
    default behavior without a ``from __future__ import annotations``
    directive.
