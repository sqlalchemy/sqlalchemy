    Fixed issue where PostgreSQL dialect options such as ``postgresql_include``
    on :class:`.PrimaryKeyConstraint` and :class:`.UniqueConstraint` were
    rendered in the wrong position when combined with constraint deferrability
    options like ``deferrable=True``. Pull request courtesy G Allajmi.
