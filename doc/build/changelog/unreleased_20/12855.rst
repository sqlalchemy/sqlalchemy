    Added new decorator :func:`_orm.mapped_as_dataclass`, which is a function
    based form of :meth:`_orm.registry.mapped_as_dataclass`; the method form
    :meth:`_orm.registry.mapped_as_dataclass` does not seem to be correctly
    recognized within the scope of :pep:`681` in recent mypy versions.
