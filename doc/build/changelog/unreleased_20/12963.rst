    :tags: bug, typing

    Fixed typing issue where :class:`.coalesce` would not return the correct
    return type when a nullable form of that argument were passed, even though
    this function is meant to select the non-null entry among possibly null
    arguments.  Pull request courtesy Yannick PÉROUX.
