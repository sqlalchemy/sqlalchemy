    Fixed issue where PostgreSQL JSONB operators
    :meth:`_postgresql.JSONB.Comparator.path_match` and
    :meth:`_postgresql.JSONB.Comparator.path_exists` were applying incorrect
    ``VARCHAR`` casts to the right-hand side operand when used with newer
    PostgreSQL drivers such as psycopg. The operators now indicate the
    right-hand type as ``JSONPATH``, which currently results in no casting
    taking place, but is also compatible with explicit casts if the
    implementation were require it at a later point.
