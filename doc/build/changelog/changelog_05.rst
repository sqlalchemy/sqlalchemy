    :released: 

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1661

      Fixed erroneous self_group() call in expression package.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      The copy() method on Column now supports uninitialized,
      unnamed Column objects. This allows easy creation of
      declarative helpers which place common columns on multiple
      subclasses.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      Default generators like Sequence() translate correctly
      across a copy() operation.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      Sequence() and other DefaultGenerator objects are accepted
      as the value for the "default" and "onupdate" keyword
      arguments of Column, in addition to being accepted
      positionally.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1568, 1617

      Fixed a column arithmetic bug that affected column
      correspondence for cloned selectables which contain
      free-standing column expressions.   This bug is
      generally only noticeable when exercising newer
      ORM behavior only available in 0.6 via,
      but is more correct at the SQL expression level
      as well.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 1647

      The extract() function, which was slightly improved in
      0.5.7, needed a lot more work to generate the correct
      typecast (the typecasts appear to be necessary in PG's
      EXTRACT quite a lot of the time).  The typecast is
      now generated using a rule dictionary based
      on PG's documentation for date/time/interval arithmetic.
      It also accepts text() constructs again, which was broken
      in 0.5.7.

    .. change::
        :tags: firebird
        :tickets: 1646

      Recognize more errors as disconnections.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.5.7
    :released: Sat Dec 26 2009

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1543

      contains_eager() now works with the automatically
      generated subquery that results when you say
      "query(Parent).join(Parent.somejoinedsubclass)", i.e.
      when Parent joins to a joined-table-inheritance subclass.
      Previously contains_eager() would erroneously add the
      subclass table to the query separately producing a
      cartesian product.  An example is in the ticket
      description.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1553

      query.options() now only propagate to loaded objects
      for potential further sub-loads only for options where
      such behavior is relevant, keeping
      various unserializable options like those generated
      by contains_eager() out of individual instance states.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1054

      Session.execute() now locates table- and
      mapper-specific binds based on a passed
      in expression which is an insert()/update()/delete()
      construct.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Session.merge() now properly overwrites a many-to-one or
      uselist=False attribute to None if the attribute
      is also None in the given object to be merged.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1618

      Fixed a needless select which would occur when merging
      transient objects that contained a null primary key
      identifier.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1585

      Mutable collection passed to the "extension" attribute
      of relation(), column_property() etc. will not be mutated
      or shared among multiple instrumentation calls, preventing
      duplicate extensions, such as backref populators,
      from being inserted into the list.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1504

      Fixed the call to get_committed_value() on CompositeProperty.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1602

      Fixed bug where Query would crash if a join() with no clear
      "left" side were called when a non-mapped column entity
      appeared in the columns list.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1616, 1480

      Fixed bug whereby composite columns wouldn't load properly
      when configured on a joined-table subclass, introduced in
      version 0.5.6 as a result of the fix for. thx to Scott Torborg.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1556

      The "use get" behavior of many-to-one relations, i.e. that a
      lazy load will fallback to the possibly cached query.get()
      value, now works across join conditions where the two compared
      types are not exactly the same class, but share the same
      "affinity" - i.e. Integer and SmallInteger.  Also allows
      combinations of reflected and non-reflected types to work
      with 0.5 style type reflection, such as PGText/Text (note 0.6
      reflects types as their generic versions).

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1436

      Fixed bug in query.update() when passing Cls.attribute
      as keys in the value dict and using synchronize_session='expire'
      ('fetch' in 0.6).

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1603

      Fixed bug in two-phase transaction whereby commit() method
      didn't set the full state which allows subsequent close()
      call to succeed.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      Fixed the "numeric" paramstyle, which apparently is the
      default paramstyle used by Informixdb.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1574

      Repeat expressions in the columns clause of a select
      are deduped based on the identity of each clause element,
      not the actual string.  This allows positional
      elements to render correctly even if they all render
      identically, such as "qmark" style bind parameters.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1632

      The cursor associated with connection pool connections
      (i.e. _CursorFairy) now proxies `__iter__()` to the
      underlying cursor correctly.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1556

      types now support an "affinity comparison" operation, i.e.
      that an Integer/SmallInteger are "compatible", or
      a Text/String, PickleType/Binary, etc.  Part of.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1641

      Fixed bug preventing alias() of an alias() from being
      cloned or adapted (occurs frequently in ORM operations).

    .. change::
        :tags: sqlite
        :tickets: 1439

      sqlite dialect properly generates CREATE INDEX for a table
      that is in an alternate schema.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 1085

      Added support for reflecting the DOUBLE PRECISION type,
      via a new postgres.PGDoublePrecision object.
      This is postgresql.DOUBLE_PRECISION in 0.6.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 460

      Added support for reflecting the INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH
      and INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND syntaxes of the INTERVAL
      type.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 1576

      Corrected the "has_sequence" query to take current schema,
      or explicit sequence-stated schema, into account.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql
        :tickets: 1611

      Fixed the behavior of extract() to apply operator
      precedence rules to the "::" operator when applying
      the "timestamp" cast - ensures proper parenthesization.

    .. change::
        :tags: mssql
        :tickets: 1561

      Changed the name of TrustedConnection to
      Trusted_Connection when constructing pyodbc connect
      arguments

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 1637

      The "table_names" dialect function, used by MetaData
      .reflect(), omits "index overflow tables", a system
      table generated by Oracle when "index only tables"
      with overflow are used.  These tables aren't accessible
      via SQL and can't be reflected.

    .. change::
        :tags: ext
        :tickets: 1570, 1523

      A column can be added to a joined-table declarative
      superclass after the class has been constructed
      (i.e. via class-level attribute assignment), and
      the column will be propagated down to
      subclasses.  This is the reverse
      situation as that of, fixed in 0.5.6.

    .. change::
        :tags: ext
        :tickets: 1491

      Fixed a slight inaccuracy in the sharding example.
      Comparing equivalence of columns in the ORM is best
      accomplished using col1.shares_lineage(col2).

    .. change::
        :tags: ext
        :tickets: 1606

      Removed unused `load()` method from ShardedQuery.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.5.6
    :released: Sat Sep 12 2009

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1300

      Fixed bug whereby inheritance discriminator part of a
      composite primary key would fail on updates.
      Continuation of.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1507

      Fixed bug which disallowed one side of a many-to-many
      bidirectional reference to declare itself as "viewonly"

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1526

      Added an assertion that prevents a @validates function
      or other AttributeExtension from loading an unloaded
      collection such that internal state may be corrupted.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1519

      Fixed bug which prevented two entities from mutually
      replacing each other's primary key values within a single
      flush() for some orderings of operations.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1485

      Fixed an obscure issue whereby a joined-table subclass
      with a self-referential eager load on the base class
      would populate the related object's "subclass" table with
      data from the "subclass" table of the parent.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1477

      relations() now have greater ability to be "overridden",
      meaning a subclass that explicitly specifies a relation()
      overriding that of the parent class will be honored
      during a flush.  This is currently to support
      many-to-many relations from concrete inheritance setups.
      Outside of that use case, YMMV.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1483

      Squeezed a few more unnecessary "lazy loads" out of
      relation().  When a collection is mutated, many-to-one
      backrefs on the other side will not fire off to load
      the "old" value, unless "single_parent=True" is set.
      A direct assignment of a many-to-one still loads
      the "old" value in order to update backref collections
      on that value, which may be present in the session
      already, thus maintaining the 0.5 behavioral contract.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1480

      Fixed bug whereby a load/refresh of joined table
      inheritance attributes which were based on
      column_property() or similar would fail to evaluate.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1488

      Improved support for MapperProperty objects overriding
      that of an inherited mapper for non-concrete
      inheritance setups - attribute extensions won't randomly
      collide with each other.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1487

      UPDATE and DELETE do not support ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET,
      etc. in standard SQL.  Query.update() and Query.delete()
      now raise an exception if any of limit(), offset(),
      order_by(), group_by(), or distinct() have been
      called.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Added AttributeExtension to sqlalchemy.orm.__all__

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1476

      Improved error message when query() is called with
      a non-SQL /entity expression.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1440

      Using False or 0 as a polymorphic discriminator now
      works on the base class as well as a subclass.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1424

      Added enable_assertions(False) to Query which disables
      the usual assertions for expected state - used
      by Query subclasses to engineer custom state..  See
      https://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/wiki/UsageRecipes/PreFilteredQuery
      for an example.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1501

      Fixed recursion issue which occurred if a mapped object's
      `__len__()` or `__nonzero__()` method resulted in state
      changes.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1506

      Fixed incorrect exception raise in
      Weak/StrongIdentityMap.add()

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1522

      Fixed the error message for "could not find a FROM clause"
      in query.join() which would fail to issue correctly
      if the query was against a pure SQL construct.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1486

      Fixed a somewhat hypothetical issue which would result
      in the wrong primary key being calculated for a mapper
      using the old polymorphic_union function - but this
      is old stuff.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1373

      Fixed column.copy() to copy defaults and onupdates.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      Fixed a bug in extract() introduced in 0.5.4 whereby
      the string "field" argument was getting treated as a
      ClauseElement, causing various errors within more
      complex SQL transformations.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1420

      Unary expressions such as DISTINCT propagate their
      type handling to result sets, allowing conversions like
      unicode and such to take place.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1482

      Fixed bug in Table and Column whereby passing empty
      dict for "info" argument would raise an exception.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 1309

      Backported 0.6 fix for Oracle alias names not getting
      truncated.

    .. change::
        :tags: ext
        :tickets: 1446

      The collection proxies produced by associationproxy are now
      pickleable.  A user-defined proxy_factory however
      is still not pickleable unless it defines __getstate__
      and __setstate__.

    .. change::
        :tags: ext
        :tickets: 1468

      Declarative will raise an informative exception if
      __table_args__ is passed as a tuple with no dict argument.
      Improved documentation.

    .. change::
        :tags: ext
        :tickets: 1527

      Table objects declared in the MetaData can now be used
      in string expressions sent to primaryjoin/secondaryjoin/
      secondary - the name is pulled from the MetaData of the
      declarative base.

    .. change::
        :tags: ext
        :tickets: 1523

      A column can be added to a joined-table subclass after
      the class has been constructed (i.e. via class-level
      attribute assignment).  The column is added to the underlying
      Table as always, but now the mapper will rebuild its
      "join" to include the new column, instead of raising
      an error about "no such column, use column_property()
      instead".

    .. change::
        :tags: test
        :tickets: 

      Added examples into the test suite so they get exercised
      regularly and cleaned up a couple deprecation warnings.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.5.5
    :released: Mon Jul 13 2009

    .. change::
        :tags: general
        :tickets: 970

      unit tests have been migrated from unittest to nose.  See
      README.unittests for information on how to run the tests.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      The "foreign_keys" argument of relation() will now propagate
      automatically to the backref in the same way that primaryjoin
      and secondaryjoin do.  For the extremely rare use case where
      the backref of a relation() has intentionally different
      "foreign_keys" configured, both sides now need to be
      configured explicitly (if they do in fact require this setting,
      see the next note...).

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      ...the only known (and really, really rare) use case where a
      different foreign_keys setting was used on the
      forwards/backwards side, a composite foreign key that
      partially points to its own columns, has been enhanced such
      that the fk->itself aspect of the relation won't be used to
      determine relation direction.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Session.mapper is now *deprecated*.
      
      Call session.add() if you'd like a free-standing object to be
      part of your session.  Otherwise, a DIY version of
      Session.mapper is now documented at
      https://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/wiki/UsageRecipes/SessionAwareMapper
      The method will remain deprecated throughout 0.6.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1431

      Fixed Query being able to join() from individual columns of a
      joined-table subclass entity, i.e.  query(SubClass.foo,
      SubClass.bar).join(<anything>).  In most cases, an error
      "Could not find a FROM clause to join from" would be
      raised. In a few others, the result would be returned in terms
      of the base class rather than the subclass - so applications
      which relied on this erroneous result need to be
      adjusted.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1461

      Fixed a bug involving contains_eager(), which would apply
      itself to a secondary (i.e. lazy) load in a particular rare
      case, producing cartesian products.  improved the targeting of
      query.options() on secondary loads overall.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Fixed bug introduced in 0.5.4 whereby Composite types fail
      when default-holding columns are flushed.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1426

      Fixed another 0.5.4 bug whereby mutable attributes
      (i.e. PickleType) wouldn't be deserialized correctly when the
      whole object was serialized.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Fixed bug whereby session.is_modified() would raise an
      exception if any synonyms were in use.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Fixed potential memory leak whereby previously pickled objects
      placed back in a session would not be fully garbage collected
      unless the Session were explicitly closed out.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Fixed bug whereby list-based attributes, like pickletype and
      PGArray, failed to be merged() properly.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Repaired non-working attributes.set_committed_value function.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Trimmed the pickle format for InstanceState which should
      further reduce the memory footprint of pickled instances.  The
      format should be backwards compatible with that of 0.5.4 and
      previous.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1463

      sqlalchemy.orm.join and sqlalchemy.orm.outerjoin are now
      added to __all__ in sqlalchemy.orm.*.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1458

      Fixed bug where Query exception raise would fail when
      a too-short composite primary key value were passed to
      get().

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      Removed an obscure feature of execute() (including connection,
      engine, Session) whereby a bindparam() construct can be sent
      as a key to the params dictionary.  This usage is undocumented
      and is at the core of an issue whereby the bindparam() object
      created implicitly by a text() construct may have the same
      hash value as a string placed in the params dictionary and may
      result in an inappropriate match when computing the final bind
      parameters.  Internal checks for this condition would add
      significant latency to the critical task of parameter
      rendering, so the behavior is removed.  This is a backwards
      incompatible change for any application that may have been
      using this feature, however the feature has never been
      documented.

    .. change::
        :tags: engine/pool
        :tickets: 

      Implemented recreate() for StaticPool.

.. changelog::

    :released: Tue May 26 2009

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      Repaired the printing of SQL exceptions which are not

      Deprecated the hardcoded TIMESTAMP function, which when
      used as func.TIMESTAMP(value) would render "TIMESTAMP value".
      This breaks on some platforms as PostgreSQL doesn't allow
      bind parameters to be used in this context.  The hard-coded
      uppercase is also inappropriate and there's lots of other
      PG casts that we'd need to support.  So instead, use
      text constructs i.e. select(["timestamp '12/05/09'"]).

      Significant performance enhancements regarding Sessions/flush()
      in conjunction with large mapper graphs, large numbers of
      objects:
      
      - Removed all* O(N) scanning behavior from the flush() process,
        i.e. operations that were scanning the full session,
        including an extremely expensive one that was erroneously
        assuming primary key values were changing when this
        was not the case.
      
        * one edge case remains which may invoke a full scan,
          if an existing primary key attribute is modified
          to a new value.
      
      - The Session's "weak referencing" behavior is now *full* -
        no strong references whatsoever are made to a mapped object
        or related items/collections in its __dict__.  Backrefs and
        other cycles in objects no longer affect the Session's ability
        to lose all references to unmodified objects.  Objects with
        pending changes still are maintained strongly until flush.
       
      
        The implementation also improves performance by moving
        the "resurrection" process of garbage collected items
        to only be relevant for mappings that map "mutable"
        attributes (i.e. PickleType, composite attrs).  This removes
        overhead from the gc process and simplifies internal
        behavior.
      
        If a "mutable" attribute change is the sole change on an object
        which is then dereferenced, the mapper will not have access to
        other attribute state when the UPDATE is issued.  This may present
        itself differently to some MapperExtensions.
      
        The change also affects the internal attribute API, but not
        the AttributeExtension interface nor any of the publicly
        documented attribute functions.
      
      - The unit of work no longer generates a graph of "dependency"
        processors for the full graph of mappers during flush(), instead
        creating such processors only for those mappers which represent
        objects with pending changes.  This saves a tremendous number
        of method calls in the context of a large interconnected
        graph of mappers.
      
      - Cached a wasteful "table sort" operation that previously
        occurred multiple times per flush, also removing significant
        method call count from flush().
      
      - Other redundant behaviors have been simplified in
        mapper._save_obj().

      Lazy loader will not use get() if the "lazy load" SQL clause
      matches the clause used by get(), but contains some parameters
      hardcoded.  Previously the lazy strategy would fail with the
      get().  Ideally get() would be used with the hardcoded
      parameters but this would require further development.

      MapperOptions and other state associated with query.options()
      is no longer bundled within callables associated with each
      lazy/deferred-loading attribute during a load.
      The options are now associated with the instance's
      state object just once when it's populated.  This removes
      the need in most cases for per-instance/attribute loader
      objects, improving load speed and memory overhead for
      individual instances.

      The "objects" argument to session.flush() is deprecated.
      State which represents the linkage between a parent and

      this operation leads to misleading results.

      Query now implements __clause_element__() which produces

      a session.expire() on a particular collection attribute

      Further refined 0.5.1's warning about delete-orphan cascade
      placed on a many-to-many relation.   First, the bad news:
      the warning will apply to both many-to-many as well as
      many-to-one relations.  This is necessary since in both
      cases, SQLA does not scan the full set of potential parents
      when determining "orphan" status - for a persistent object
      it only detects an in-python de-association event to establish
      the object as an "orphan".  Next, the good news: to support
      one-to-one via a foreign key or association table, or to
      support one-to-many via an association table, a new flag
      single_parent=True may be set which indicates objects
      linked to the relation are only meant to have a single parent.
      The relation will raise an error if multiple parent-association
      events occur within Python.

      Concrete inheriting mappers now instrument attributes which

      Added a new `relation()` keyword `back_populates`. This

      Mappers now instrument class attributes upon construction
      with the final InstrumentedAttribute object which remains
      persistent. The `_CompileOnAttr`/`__getattribute__()`
      methodology has been removed. The net effect is that
      Column-based mapped class attributes can now be used fully
      at the class level without invoking a mapper compilation
      operation, greatly simplifying typical usage patterns
      within declarative.

      Fixed a bug with the unitofwork's "row switch" mechanism,
      i.e. the conversion of INSERT/DELETE into an UPDATE, when

      Using delete-orphan on a many-to-many relation is deprecated.
      This produces misleading or erroneous results since SQLA does
      not retrieve the full list of "parents" for m2m.  To get delete-orphan
      behavior with an m2m table, use an explicit association class
      so that the individual association row is treated as a parent.

      Fixed bug when overriding a Column with a ForeignKey
      on a reflected table, where derived columns (i.e. the
      "virtual" columns of a select, etc.) would inadvertently
      call upon schema-level cleanup logic intended only
      for the original column.

      Can now specify Column objects on subclasses which have no
      table of their own (i.e. use single table inheritance).
      The columns will be appended to the base table, but only
      mapped by the subclass.

    .. change::
        :tags: declarative
        :tickets: 

      For both joined and single inheriting subclasses, the subclass
      will only map those columns which are already mapped on the
      superclass and those explicit on the subclass.  Other
      columns that are present on the `Table` will be excluded
      from the mapping by default, which can be disabled
      by passing a blank `exclude_properties` collection to the
      `__mapper_args__`.  This is so that single-inheriting
      classes which define their own columns are the only classes
      to map those columns.   The effect is actually a more organized
      mapping than you'd normally get with explicit `mapper()`
      calls unless you set up the `exclude_properties` arguments
      explicitly.

      Documentation has been converted to Sphinx.  In particular,
      the generated API documentation has been constructed into a
      full blown "API Reference" section which organizes editorial
      documentation combined with generated docstrings.  Cross

      setup.py now imports setuptools only optionally.  If not

      Query.with_polymorphic() now accepts a third argument
      "discriminator" which will replace the value of
      mapper.polymorphic_on for that query.  Mappers themselves no
      longer require polymorphic_on to be set, even if the mapper
      has a polymorphic_identity.  When not set, the mapper will
      load non-polymorphically by default. Together, these two
      features allow a non-polymorphic concrete inheritance setup to
      use polymorphic loading on a per-query basis, since concrete
      setups are prone to many issues when used polymorphically in
      all cases.

      query.order_by() accepts None which will remove any pending
      order_by state from the query, as well as cancel out any

        :tickets: 

      Exceptions raised during compile_mappers() are now preserved
      to provide "sticky behavior" - if a hasattr() call on a
      pre-compiled mapped attribute triggers a failing compile and
      suppresses the exception, subsequent compilation is blocked
      and the exception will be reiterated on the next compile()
      call.  This issue occurs frequently when using declarative.

      property.of_type() is now recognized on a single-table

      query.join() raises an error when the target of the join

      Custom comparator classes used in conjunction with

      Duplicate items in a list-based collection will be maintained
      when issuing INSERTs to a "secondary" table in a many-to-many
      relation.  Assuming the m2m table has a unique or primary key
      constraint on it, this will raise the expected constraint
      violation instead of silently dropping the duplicate
      entries. Note that the old behavior remains for a one-to-many
      relation since collection entries in that case don't result in
      INSERT statements and SQLA doesn't manually police
      collections.

      Two fixes to help prevent out-of-band columns from being
      rendered in polymorphic_union inheritance scenarios (which
      then causes extra tables to be rendered in the FROM clause
      causing cartesian products):
      
        - improvements to "column adaption" for a->b->c inheritance
          situations to better locate columns that are related to
          one another via multiple levels of indirection, rather
          than rendering the non-adapted column.
      
        - the "polymorphic discriminator" column is only rendered
          for the actual mapper being queried against. The column
          won't be "pulled in" from a subclass or superclass mapper
          since it's not needed.

      ``MSBinary`` now returns a ``BINARY`` instead of an

      Support for three levels of column nullability: NULL, NOT
      NULL, and the database's configured default.  The default
      Column configuration (nullable=True) will now generate NULL in

      database default would take effect (usually NULL, but not
      always).  To explicitly request the database default,
      configure columns with nullable=None and no specification will
      be emitted in DDL. This is backwards incompatible

      Query.count() has been enhanced to do the "right thing" in a
      wider variety of cases. It can now count multiple-entity
      queries, as well as column-based queries. Note that this means
      if you say query(A, B).count() without any joining criterion,
      it's going to count the cartesian product of A*B. Any query
      which is against column-based entities will automatically
      issue "SELECT count(1) FROM (SELECT...)" so that the real
      rowcount is returned, meaning a query such as
      query(func.count(A.name)).count() will return a value of one,
      since that query would return one row.

      Added a new extension sqlalchemy.ext.serializer.  Provides

      key context-sensitive objects, including engines, sessions,
      metadata, Tables/Columns, and mappers, outside of the pickle
      stream, and can later restore the pickle using any
      engine/metadata/session provider. This is used not for
      pickling regular object instances, which are pickleable
      without any special logic, but for pickling expression objects
      and full Query objects, such that all mapper/engine/session
      dependencies can be restored at unpickle time.

      Temporary tables are now reflectable.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 1187

      Oracle will detect string-based statements which contain
      comments at the front before a SELECT as SELECT statements.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.5.0rc1
    :released: Thu Sep 11 2008

      Query now has delete() and update(values) methods. This allows
      to perform bulk deletes/updates with the Query object.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      The RowTuple object returned by Query(\*cols) now features
      keynames which prefer mapped attribute names over column keys,
      column keys over column names, i.e.  Query(Class.foo,
      Class.bar) will have names "foo" and "bar" even if those are
      not the names of the underlying Column objects.  Direct Column
      objects such as Query(table.c.col) will return the "key"
      attribute of the Column.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Added scalar() and value() methods to Query, each return a
      single scalar value.  scalar() takes no arguments and is
      roughly equivalent to first()[0], value()
      takes a single column expression and is roughly equivalent to
      values(expr).next()[0].

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Improved the determination of the FROM clause when placing SQL
      expressions in the query() list of entities.  In particular
      scalar subqueries should not "leak" their inner FROM objects
      out into the enclosing query.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Joins along a relation() from a mapped class to a mapped
      subclass, where the mapped subclass is configured with single
      table inheritance, will include an IN clause which limits the
      subtypes of the joined class to those requested, within the ON
      clause of the join.  This takes effect for eager load joins as
      well as query.join().  Note that in some scenarios the IN
      clause will appear in the WHERE clause of the query as well
      since this discrimination has multiple trigger points.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      AttributeExtension has been refined such that the event
      is fired before the mutation actually occurs.  Additionally,
      the append() and set() methods must now return the given value,
      which is used as the value to be used in the mutation operation.
      This allows creation of validating AttributeListeners which
      raise before the action actually occurs, and which can change
      the given value into something else before its used.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      column_property(), composite_property(), and relation() now
      accept a single or list of AttributeExtensions using the
      "extension" keyword argument.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      query.order_by().get() silently drops the "ORDER BY" from
      the query issued by GET but does not raise an exception.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Added a Validator AttributeExtension, as well as a
      @validates decorator which is used in a similar fashion
      as @reconstructor, and marks a method as validating
      one or more mapped attributes.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1140

      class.someprop.in_() raises NotImplementedError pending the
      implementation of "in\_" for relation

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1127

      Fixed primary key update for many-to-many collections where
      the collection had not been loaded yet

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Fixed bug whereby deferred() columns with a group in conjunction
      with an otherwise unrelated synonym() would produce
      an AttributeError during deferred load.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1128

      The before_flush() hook on SessionExtension takes place before
      the list of new/dirty/deleted is calculated for the final
      time, allowing routines within before_flush() to further
      change the state of the Session before the flush proceeds.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      The "extension" argument to Session and others can now
      optionally be a list, supporting events sent to multiple
      SessionExtension instances.  Session places SessionExtensions
      in Session.extensions.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Reentrant calls to flush() raise an error.  This also serves
      as a rudimentary, but not foolproof, check against concurrent
      calls to Session.flush().

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Improved the behavior of query.join() when joining to
      joined-table inheritance subclasses, using explicit join
      criteria (i.e. not on a relation).

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      @orm.attributes.reconstitute and
      MapperExtension.reconstitute have been renamed to
      @orm.reconstructor and MapperExtension.reconstruct_instance

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1129

      Fixed @reconstructor hook for subclasses which inherit from a
      base class.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1132

      The composite() property type now supports a
      __set_composite_values__() method on the composite class which
      is required if the class represents state using attribute
      names other than the column's keynames; default-generated
      values now get populated properly upon flush.  Also,
      composites with attributes set to None compare correctly.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      The 3-tuple of iterables returned by attributes.get_history()
      may now be a mix of lists and tuples.  (Previously members
      were always lists.)

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1151

      Fixed bug whereby changing a primary key attribute on an
      entity where the attribute's previous value had been expired
      would produce an error upon flush().

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Fixed custom instrumentation bug whereby get_instance_dict()
      was not called for newly constructed instances not loaded
      by the ORM.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1150

      Session.delete() adds the given object to the session if
      not already present.  This was a regression bug from 0.4.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      The `echo_uow` flag on `Session` is deprecated, and unit-of-work
      logging is now application-level only, not per-session level.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1153

      Removed conflicting `contains()` operator from
      `InstrumentedAttribute` which didn't accept `escape` kwaarg.

    .. change::
        :tags: declarative
        :tickets: 1161

      Fixed bug whereby mapper couldn't initialize if a composite
      primary key referenced another table that was not defined
      yet.

    .. change::
        :tags: declarative
        :tickets: 

      Fixed exception throw which would occur when string-based
      primaryjoin condition was used in conjunction with backref.

    .. change::
        :tags: schema
        :tickets: 1033

      Added "sorted_tables" accessor to MetaData, which returns
      Table objects sorted in order of dependency as a list.
      This deprecates the MetaData.table_iterator() method.
      The "reverse=False" keyword argument has also been
      removed from util.sort_tables(); use the Python
      'reversed' function to reverse the results.

    .. change::
        :tags: schema
        :tickets: 

      The 'length' argument to all Numeric types has been renamed
      to 'scale'.  'length' is deprecated and is still accepted
      with a warning.

    .. change::
        :tags: schema
        :tickets: 

      Dropped 0.3-compatibility for user defined types
      (convert_result_value, convert_bind_param).

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1068

      Temporarily rolled back the "ORDER BY" enhancement from.  This feature is on hold pending further
      development.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      The exists() construct won't "export" its contained list
      of elements as FROM clauses, allowing them to be used more
      effectively in the columns clause of a SELECT.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 798

      and_() and or_() now generate a ColumnElement, allowing
      boolean expressions as result columns, i.e.
      select([and_(1, 0)]).

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      Bind params now subclass ColumnElement which allows them to be
      selectable by orm.query (they already had most ColumnElement
      semantics).

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      Added select_from() method to exists() construct, which becomes
      more and more compatible with a regular select().

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1160

      Added func.min(), func.max(), func.sum() as "generic functions",
      which basically allows for their return type to be determined
      automatically.  Helps with dates on SQLite, decimal types,
      others.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      added decimal.Decimal as an "auto-detect" type; bind parameters
      and generic functions will set their type to Numeric when a
      Decimal is used.

    .. change::
        :tags: mysql
        :tickets: 

      The 'length' argument to MSInteger, MSBigInteger, MSTinyInteger,
      MSSmallInteger and MSYear has been renamed to 'display_width'.

    .. change::
        :tags: mysql
        :tickets: 1146

      Added MSMediumInteger type.

    .. change::
        :tags: mysql
        :tickets: 

      the function func.utc_timestamp() compiles to UTC_TIMESTAMP, without
      the parenthesis, which seem to get in the way when using in
      conjunction with executemany().

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 536

      limit/offset no longer uses ROW NUMBER OVER to limit rows,
      and instead uses subqueries in conjunction with a special
      Oracle optimization comment.  Allows LIMIT/OFFSET to work
      in conjunction with DISTINCT.

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 1155

      has_sequence() now takes the current "schema" argument into
      account

    .. change::
        :tags: oracle
        :tickets: 1121

      added BFILE to reflected type names

      The "entity_name" feature of SQLAlchemy mappers has been
      removed.  For rationale, see https://tinyurl.com/6nm2ne

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      the "autoexpire" flag on Session, sessionmaker(), and
      scoped_session() has been renamed to "expire_on_commit".  It
      does not affect the expiration behavior of rollback().

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      fixed endless loop bug which could occur within a mapper's
      deferred load of inherited attributes.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      a legacy-support flag "_enable_transaction_accounting" flag
      added to Session which when False, disables all
      transaction-level object accounting, including expire on
      rollback, expire on commit, new/deleted list maintenance, and
      autoflush on begin.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      The 'cascade' parameter to relation() accepts None as a value,
      which is equivalent to no cascades.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 

      A critical fix to dynamic relations allows the "modified"
      history to be properly cleared after a flush().

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      user-defined @properties on a class are detected and left in
      place during mapper initialization.  This means that a
      table-bound column of the same name will not be mapped at all
      if a @property is in the way (and the column is not remapped
      to a different name), nor will an instrumented attribute from
      an inherited class be applied.  The same rules apply for names
      excluded using the include_properties/exclude_properties
      collections.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Added a new SessionExtension hook called after_attach().  This
      is called at the point of attachment for objects via add(),
      add_all(), delete(), and merge().

    .. change::

        :tickets: 1111

      A mapper which inherits from another, when inheriting the
      columns of its inherited mapper, will use any reassigned
      property names specified in that inheriting mapper.
      Previously, if "Base" had reassigned "base_id" to the name
      "id", "SubBase(Base)" would still get an attribute called
      "base_id".  This could be worked around by explicitly stating
      the column in each submapper as well but this is fairly
      unworkable and also impossible when using declarative.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 

      Fixed a series of potential race conditions in Session whereby
      asynchronous GC could remove unmodified, no longer referenced
      items from the session as they were present in a list of items
      to be processed, typically during session.expunge_all() and
      dependent methods.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 

      Some improvements to the _CompileOnAttr mechanism which should
      reduce the probability of "Attribute x was not replaced during
      compile" warnings. (this generally applies to SQLA hackers,
      like Elixir devs).

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Fixed bug whereby the "unsaved, pending instance" FlushError
      raised for a pending orphan would not take superclass mappers
      into account when generating the list of relations responsible
      for the error.

    .. change::

      func.count() with no arguments renders as COUNT(*), equivalent

        :tickets: 1068

      simple label names in ORDER BY expressions render as
      themselves, and not as a re-statement of their corresponding
      expression.  This feature is currently enabled only for
      SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.  It can be enabled on other
      dialects as each is shown to support this
      behavior.

    .. change::
        :tags: ext
        :tickets: 

      Class-bound attributes sent as arguments to relation()'s
      remote_side and foreign_keys parameters are now accepted,
      allowing them to be used with declarative.  Additionally fixed
      bugs involving order_by being specified as a class-bound
      attribute in conjunction with eager loading.

    .. change::
        :tags: ext
        :tickets: 

      declarative initialization of Columns adjusted so that
      non-renamed columns initialize in the same way as a non
      declarative mapper.  This allows an inheriting mapper to set
      up its same-named "id" columns in particular such that the
      parent "id" column is favored over the child column, reducing
      database round trips when this value is requested.

        :tickets: 1110

      Quoting of MSEnum values for use in CREATE TABLE is now

      lazy loaders now trigger autoflush before proceeding.  This

      properly in the context of autoflush.

    .. change::

        :tickets: 887

      column_property() attributes which represent SQL expressions
      or columns that are not present in the mapped tables (such as
      those from views) are automatically expired after an INSERT or
      UPDATE, assuming they have not been locally modified, so that
      they are refreshed with the most recent data upon access.

    .. change::

      Fixed explicit, self-referential joins between two

      Modified SQLite's representation of "microseconds" to match
      the output of str(somedatetime), i.e. in that the microseconds
      are represented as fractional seconds in string format.  This
      makes SQLA's SQLite date type compatible with datetimes that
      were saved directly using Pysqlite (which just calls str()).
      Note that this is incompatible with the existing microseconds
      values in a SQLA 0.4 generated SQLite database file.
      
      To get the old behavior globally:
      
           from sqlalchemy.databases.sqlite import DateTimeMixin
           DateTimeMixin.__legacy_microseconds__ = True
      
      To get the behavior on individual DateTime types:
      
            t = sqlite.SLDateTime()
            t.__legacy_microseconds__ = True
      
      Then use "t" as the type on the Column.

      SQLite Date, DateTime, and Time types only accept Python
      datetime objects now, not strings.  If you'd like to format
      dates as strings yourself with SQLite, use a String type.  If
      you'd like them to return datetime objects anyway despite
      their accepting strings as input, make a TypeDecorator around
      String - SQLA doesn't encourage this pattern.

        :tags: 
        :tickets: 

      Moved entity_name, _sa_session_id, and _instance_key from the
      instance object to the instance state.  These values are still
      available in the old way, which is now deprecated, using
      descriptors attached to the class.  A deprecation warning will
      be issued when accessed.

    .. change::
        :tags: 
        :tickets: 

      The _prepare_instrumentation alias for prepare_instrumentation
      has been removed.

    .. change::
        :tags: 
        :tickets: 

      sqlalchemy.exceptions has been renamed to sqlalchemy.exc.  The
      module may be imported under either name.

    .. change::
        :tags: 
        :tickets: 

      ORM-related exceptions are now defined in sqlalchemy.orm.exc.
      ConcurrentModificationError, FlushError, and
      UnmappedColumnError compatibility aliases are installed in
      sqlalchemy.exc during the import of sqlalchemy.orm.

    .. change::
        :tags:

      sqlalchemy.logging has been renamed to sqlalchemy.log.

    .. change::
        :tags:

      The transitional sqlalchemy.log.SADeprecationWarning alias for
      the warning's definition in sqlalchemy.exc has been removed.

    .. change::
        :tags: 
        :tickets: 

      exc.AssertionError has been removed and usage replaced with
      Python's built-in AssertionError.

    .. change::
        :tags: 
        :tickets: 

      The behavior of MapperExtensions attached to multiple,
      entity_name= primary mappers for a single class has been
      altered.  The first mapper() defined for a class is the only
      mapper eligible for the MapperExtension 'instrument_class',
      'init_instance' and 'init_failed' events.  This is backwards
      incompatible; previously the extensions of last mapper defined
      would receive these events.

    .. change::
        :tags: firebird
        :tickets: 

      Added support for returning values from inserts (2.0+ only),
      updates and deletes (2.1+ only).

      polymorphic_union() function respects the "key" of each
      Column if they differ from the column's name.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1199

      Fixed 0.4-only bug preventing composite columns
      from working properly with inheriting mappers

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 

      Fixed RLock-related bug in mapper which could deadlock upon
      reentrant mapper compile() calls, something that occurs when
      using declarative constructs inside of ForeignKey objects.
      Ported from 0.5.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1213

      Fixed bug in composite types which prevented a primary-key
      composite type from being mutated.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 976

      Added ScopedSession.is_active accessor.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 939

      Class-bound accessor can be used as the argument to
      relation() order_by.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm
        :tickets: 1072

      Fixed shard_id argument on ShardedSession.execute().

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 1246

      Connection.invalidate() checks for closed status
      to avoid attribute errors.

        :tickets: 1094

      NullPool supports reconnect on failure behavior.

      The per-dialect cache used by TypeEngine to cache
      dialect-specific types is now a WeakKeyDictionary.
      This to prevent dialect objects from
      being referenced forever for an application that
      creates an arbitrarily large number of engines
      or dialects.   There is a small performance penalty
      which will be resolved in 0.6.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql
        :tickets: 

      Fixed SQLite reflection methods so that non-present
      cursor.description, which triggers an auto-cursor
      close, will be detected so that no results doesn't
      fail on recent versions of pysqlite which raise
      an error when fetchone() called with no rows present.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgres
        :tickets: 714

      Added Index reflection support to Postgres, using a
      great patch we long neglected, submitted by
      Ken Kuhlman.

    .. change::
        :tags: mysql
        :tickets: 1241

        :tickets: 1265

      Fixed bug which was preventing out params of certain types
      from being received; thanks a ton to huddlej at wwu.edu !
