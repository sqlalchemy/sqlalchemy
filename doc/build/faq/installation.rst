I'm getting an error about greenlet not being installed when I try to use asyncio
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``greenlet`` dependency does not install by default for CPU architectures
for which ``greenlet`` does not supply a `pre-built binary wheel <https://pypi.org/project/greenlet/#files>`_.
To install including ``greenlet``,
add the ``asyncio`` `setuptools extra <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-setuptools-extras>`_
to the ``pip install`` command:

.. sourcecode:: text

    pip install sqlalchemy[asyncio]
