# Contributing to SQLAlchemy

For general developer guidelines, please see out current Developer Guide at
[Develop](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/develop.html).

## Note on use of AI, agents and bots ##

Some of us here use large language models (LLM) to help us with our work, and
some of us are even employer mandated to do so.   Getting help whereever you
need is fine.

However we must ask that **AI/LLM generated content is not spammed onto SQLAlchemy
discussions, issues, or PRs**, whether this is cut and pasted, fully automated,
or even just lightly edited.   **Please use your own words and don't come
off like you're a bot**, because that only makes you seem like you're trying
to gamify our organization for unearned gain.

In particular, **users who post content that appears to be trolling for karma /
upvotes / vanity commits / positive responses, whether or not this content is
machine generated, will be banned**.  We are not a casino and we're not here
to be part of gamification of any kind.
