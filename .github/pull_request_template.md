**TL;DR: don't submit a one liner "fix" for a code bug, show us your use case. We will fix it.**

Is this pull request fixing a bug in the code and not just a typo in the documentation?   If so, does your pull request include a **TEST CASE** ?   Or have you filed a proper bug report that includes a **TEST CASE** ?

*** **WE DO NOT ACCEPT ONE-LINER CODE-FIX PULL REQUESTS WITH NO TESTS.** ***  The SQLAlchemy project does **NOT** merge bug fixes that aren't verified through tests, since such unverified code **IS A BUG**.   If you would like us to write the tests, that is fine, please **FILE A BUG REPORT** which includes a **TEST SCRIPT**.   

The vast majority of "drive by" pull requests are incorrect solutions to an ill-defined problem.  Please don't assume that the one line that fixed your problem is the actual fix, **NO MATTER HOW TRIVIAL**.    And above all **HAVE A NICE DAY!!**
