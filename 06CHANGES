- orm
    - the 'expire' option on query.update() has been renamed to 'fetch', thus matching
      that of query.delete()
    - query.update() and query.delete() both default to 'evaluate' for the synchronize 
      strategy.
    - the 'synchronize' strategy for update() and delete() raises an error on failure.  
      There is no implicit fallback onto "fetch".   Failure of evaluation is based
      on the structure of criteria, so success/failure is deterministic based on 
      code structure.

- engines
    - transaction isolation level may be specified with
      create_engine(... isolation_level="..."); available on
      postgresql and sqlite. [ticket:443]
    - added first() method to ResultProxy, returns first row and closes
      result set immediately.

- schema
    - deprecated metadata.connect() and threadlocalmetadata.connect() have been 
      removed - send the "bind" attribute to bind a metadata.
    - deprecated metadata.table_iterator() method removed (use sorted_tables)
    - the "metadata" argument is removed from DefaultGenerator and subclasses,
      but remains locally present on Sequence, which is a standalone construct
      in DDL.
    - Removed public mutability from Index and Constraint objects:
        - ForeignKeyConstraint.append_element()
        - Index.append_column()
        - UniqueConstraint.append_column()
        - PrimaryKeyConstraint.add()
        - PrimaryKeyConstraint.remove()
      These should be constructed declaratively (i.e. in one construction).
    - UniqueConstraint, Index, PrimaryKeyConstraint all accept lists
      of column names or column objects as arguments.
    - Other removed things:
        - Table.key (no idea what this was for)
        - Table.primary_key is not assignable - use table.append_constraint(PrimaryKeyConstraint(...))
        - Column.bind       (get via column.table.bind)
        - Column.metadata   (get via column.table.metadata)
    - the use_alter flag on ForeignKey is now a shortcut option for operations that 
      can be hand-constructed using the DDL() event system.  A side effect of this refactor
      is that ForeignKeyConstraint objects with use_alter=True will *not* be emitted on
      SQLite, which does not support ALTER for foreign keys.  This has no effect on SQLite's 
      behavior since SQLite does not actually honor FOREIGN KEY constraints.
    
- DDL
    - the DDL() system has been greatly expanded:
        - CreateTable()
        - DropTable()
        - AddConstraint()
        - DropConstraint()
        - CreateIndex()
        - DropIndex()
        - CreateSequence()
        - DropSequence()
        - these support "on" and "execute-at()" just like
          plain DDL() does.
    - the "on" callable passed to DDL() needs to accept **kw arguments.
      In the case of MetaData before/after create/drop, the list of 
      Table objects for which CREATE/DROP DDL is to be issued is passed
      as the kw argument "tables".   This is necessary for metadata-level
      DDL that is dependent on the presence of specific tables.
    
- dialect refactor
    - the "owner" keyword argument is removed from Table.  Use "schema" to 
      represent any namespaces to be prepended to the table name.
    - server_version_info becomes a static attribute.
    - dialects receive an initialize() event on initial connection to
      determine connection properties.
    - dialects receive a visit_pool event have an opportunity to
      establish pool listeners.
    - cached TypeEngine classes are cached per-dialect class instead of per-dialect.
    - Deprecated Dialect.get_params() removed.
    - Dialect.get_rowcount() has been renamed to a descriptor "rowcount", and calls 
      cursor.rowcount directly.  Dialects which need to hardwire a rowcount in for 
      certain calls should override the method to provide different behavior.
    
    
- mysql
    - all the _detect_XXX() functions now run once underneath dialect.initialize()
    
- new dialects
    - pg8000
    - pyodbc+mysql
    
- mssql
    - the "has_window_funcs" flag is removed.  LIMIT/OFFSET usage will use ROW NUMBER as always,
      and if on an older version of SQL Server, the operation fails.  The behavior is exactly
      the same except the error is raised by SQL server instead of the dialect, and no
      flag setting is required to enable it.
    - using new dialect.initialize() feature to set up version-dependent behavior.
    
- types
    - PickleType now uses == for comparison of values when mutable=True, 
      unless the "comparator" argument with a comparsion function is specified to the type.  
      Objects being pickled will be compared based on identity (which defeats the purpose
      of mutable=True) if __eq__() is not overridden or a comparison function is not provided.
    - The default "precision" and "scale" arguments of Numeric and Float have been removed 
      and now default to None.   NUMERIC and FLOAT will be rendered with no numeric arguments
      by default unless these values are provided.
