"""Illustrates a mixin which provides a generic association
using a single target table and a single association table,
referred to by all parent tables.  The association table
contains a "discriminator" column which determines what type of
parent object associates to each particular row in the association
table.

SQLAlchemy's single-table-inheritance feature is used
to target different association types.

This configuration attempts to simulate a so-called "generic foreign key"
as closely as possible without actually foregoing the use of real
foreign keys.   Unlike table-per-related and table-per-association,
it uses a fixed number of tables to serve any number of potential parent
objects, but is also slightly more complex.
