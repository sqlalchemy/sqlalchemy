"""Illustrates a mixin which provides a generic association
via a individually generated association tables for each parent class.
The associated objects themselves are persisted in a single table
shared among all parents.

This configuration has the advantage that all Address
rows are in one table, so that the definition of "Address"
can be maintained in one place.   The association table
contains the foreign key to Address so that Address
has no dependency on the system.
