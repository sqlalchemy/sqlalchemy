"""Illustrates a so-called "generic foreign key", in a similar fashion
to that of popular frameworks such as Django, ROR, etc.  This
approach bypasses standard referential integrity
practices, in that the "foreign key" column is not actually
constrained to refer to any particular table; instead,
in-application logic is used to determine which table is referenced.

This approach is not in line with SQLAlchemy's usual style, as foregoing
foreign key integrity means that the tables can easily contain invalid
references and also have no ability to use in-database cascade functionality.

However, due to the popularity of these systems, as well as that it uses
the fewest number of tables (which doesn't really offer any "advantage",
though seems to be comforting to many) this recipe remains in
high demand, so in the interests of having an easy StackOverflow answer
queued up, here it is.   The author recommends "table_per_related"
or "table_per_association" instead of this approach.
