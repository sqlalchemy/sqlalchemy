"""Drop Oracle Database, SQL Server databases that are left over from a
multiprocessing test run.

Currently the cx_Oracle driver seems to sometimes not release a
TCP connection even if close() is called, which prevents the provisioning
system from dropping a database in-process.

For SQL Server, databases still remain in use after tests run and
running a kill of all detected sessions does not seem to release the
database in process.
